 Okay, here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed.
 One winner. 42 losers. I eat losers for breakfast.
 Breakfast? Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast? A little breaky could be good for me. No, no, no, stay focused.Speed!
 I'm faster than fast, quicker than quick! I am Lightning!
 [pounds on his trailer door] Hey Lightning, you ready?
McQueen [‘Real Gone” by Sheryl Crow plays in the background as the trailer door opens]Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready.
McQueen Ka-chow!
 Get your antenna balls here!
 You got that right, Slick. [whistles]
 [Then the camera shows Bob Cutlass and Darrell Cartrip, car versions of Bob Costas and Darrell Waltrip, announcing the race] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400, I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip, we're midway through what may turn out to be a historic day for racing.
 Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof right now. If this gets anymore exciting, they're gonna have to throw me out of the booth!
 Right you are, Darrell. Three cars are tied for the season points lead, heading into the final race of the season. And the winner of this race Darrell, will win the season title and, the Piston Cup. Does The King, Strip Weathers, have one more victory in him before retirement?
 He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years! Can he win them one last Piston Cup?
 And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks. He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.
 Chick thought this was his year, Bob. His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow. But the last thing he expected was... Lightning McQueen!
 You know, I don't think anybody expected this. The rookie sensation came into the season unknown. But everyone knows him now.
 Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
 The legend, the runner up, and the rookie! Three cars, one champion!
 No, you don't. [McQueen then moves to the left and finally overtakes Chick's, McQueen chuckles,]
 Hey![Chick then gains on McQueen as Real Gone ends. Chick then bumps McQueen, causing him to slide off the track onto the infield. The crowd is heard booing to what had happened.]
 Ooh. What a ride!
 [laughs]
 Go get 'em, McQueen! Go get 'em! We love you, Lightning! [whistles, McQueen then drives back on the track, behind all of the other racers. Chick then looks back to see McQueen far behind him.]
 Dinoco's all mine. [bumps a race car named Winford Bradford Rutherford, who slides into the wall, and collides with all of the other racers]
 Trouble, turn-3!
 [chuckles] Get through that, McQueen.
 Oh, a huge crash behind the leaders!
 [gasps, the camera then shows all of the different racers as they collide, with one flying through the air, and one losing its tire. Claude Scruggs and another racer named Billy Oilchanger then stop, facing towards each other. Claude giggles,grunts as he gets hit by another racer, gasps as another racer named Todd Marcus comes towards him,Claude then gets hit by Todd, ending upside down on Todd's roof, Claude and Todd screams, then the camera shows McQueen, who is driving through the wreckage and dodging the other racers.]
 Wait a second, Darrell. McQueen is in the wreckage.
 There's no way the rookie can make it through! Not in one piece that is. [McQueen continues dodging the other racers who are sliding across the track. Then he bounces on Claude's undercarriage up into the air. McQueen exhales deeply and having his tongue down. Then he moves his tire towards the audience, as a reflection of McQueen's bolt sticker shines on them]
 Yeah.....
 Lightning, ahh!
 [McQueen then lands back on the ground.] Look at that, McQueen made it through!
 Man, a spectacular move by Lightning McQueen.
McQueen Yeah! Ka-chow!
 McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
 Yeah McQueen! Ka-chow!
 While everyone else heads into the pits, McQueen stays out to take the lead!
 [While Bob is talking, a pace car named Charlie Checker appears in front of McQueen. Then the camera then shows a tow truck named Tow towing a damaged racer called Chuck Armstrong] Don't take me out coach. I can still race! [The camera then shows most of the other racers having a pit stop. It then shows Chick, while his pities are changing his tires.]
 [chuckles] What do you think boys? A thing of beauty.
 McQueen made it through!
 What?! [The camera then shows the TV screen, which McQueen is still on the track.]
 He's not pitting!
 [angrily] Come on, you gotta get me out there! Let's go! Get me back out there! Come on!
 McQueen's not going into the pits!
 You know the rookie just fired his crew chief. That's the third one this season!
 [The other racers are seen driving through the pit lane back onto the track] Well, he says he likes working alone, Darrell. [While Bob is talking, Chick is seen ending his pit stop as the other racers are driving past him, Chick then starts off, getting in the middle of the queue.]
 Go, go, go, go, go and go!
 Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.
 Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up. Get ready boys, we're coming to the restart! [The crowd cheers as the race restarts with McQueen progressing through in first place. Meanwhile, Chick is struggling to get past the other racers, overtaking a racer named Greg Candyman, McQueen continues progressing through the race in the lead]
 Come on, come on, come on![after overtaking a racer named Ponchy Wipeout, then the King overtakes a white car named Matthew Overtaker. Finally, McQueen comes into the pits. His pit crew arrives, with the crew chief named Not Chuck, putting fuel into McQueen]
 We need tires now! Come on, let's go!
 No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas! [drives away]
 [angrily] WHAT?! YOU NEED TIRES, YOU IDIOT!!! [One of the pities slams a tire onto the ground.]
 Looks like it's all gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
 That's right. No tires again.
 And normally I'd say that's a short-term gain, long-term loss, but it sure is working for him. Hey, he obviously knows somethin' we don't know.
 This is it, Darrell, one lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
 Ah, he's got it in the bag. Call in the dogs and put out the fire! We're gonna crown us a new champion! :Fans: [all cheering and whistling, Mia and Tia screams in excitement]
 Checkered flag, here I come! [Suddenly, McQueen's left rear tire blows]
 Oh no, ! McQueen has blown a tire!
 And with only one turn to go! Can he make it?
 YOU FOOL!!! [grunts and knocks down a cart of tires, McQueen is struggling to get to the finish line while his bare wheel causes sparks on the track. The camera then shows the King and Chick as they see McQueen's wheel on the TV screen with no tire.]
 [on radio] McQueen's blown a tire, McQueen's blown a tire! Go, go, go, go, go, go! [The King and Chick then go faster as McQueen is driving slightly slower with one tire lost, McQueen grunts as he falls and finally lands onto the ground. Suddenly, his right rear tire blows.]
 Ahh!
 He's lostanothertire! The King and Chick are coming up fast!
 They're entering turn-3.
 Come on! [He grunts as he falls and finally lands onto the ground, the camera shows the other racers catching up.]
 I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob! Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup! [McQueen gasps and continuously does several jumps towards the finish line as the King and Chick are getting closer, Chick growls and finally gets beside the King, but not in front of him]
 The King and Chick rounding turn-4. [McQueen is still jumping continuously towards the finish line as the King and Chick get closer and closer.]
 And down the stretch they come! And its... and its...! [The King and Chick cross the finish line along with McQueen stretching his tongue out over it.]
 It's too close to call! Too close to call!
 I don't believe it! I don't believe it!
 Lightning! [Screams, all cheering]
 [while Darrell is talking] The most spectacular, amazing unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world! And we don't even know who won!
 I don't believe! I don't believe! I don't believe! Look at that! [The officials are then shown watching replays of the finish at different angles. Meanwhile, one of the security officers, named Richard Clayton Kensington, notices someone watching them with a camera.]
 Hey, no Cameras! Get outta here! [The screen shows from a reporter's camera filming Kori Turbowitz with McQueen and his pit crew as the Rust-eze pitties change his tires]
We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the race results. McQueen that was quite a risky move, not taking tires.
Tell me about it.
Are you sorry you don't have a crew chief out there?
 [laughs]
 [Chuckles]Oh, Kori, there's a lot more to racing than just winning. I mean, taking the race by a full lap, where's the entertainment in that? No, no, no, I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
Sizzle?
Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief? No, I'm not. Cause I'm a one-man show.
What? Oh, yeah right.
 [to the TV audience]That was a very confident Lightning McQueen. Coming to you live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz.
 [Kori then drives away, while the reporter tries to get McQueen's bolt sticker on the TV screen. Not Chuck was blocking the view while changing one of McQueen's tires]Hey, get out of the shot!
Yo, Chuck, what are you doing? You're blocking the camera! Everyone wants to see the bolt!
WHAT?!
 Now, back away.
 [grunts angrily and slams his air wrench towards the ground]THAT'S IT!! Come on, guys![The Rust-eze pitties then leave, as one of the pitties drops his side onto the ground]
OOWWWWW!Whoa, team! Where are you going?
 [angrily] WeQUIT, Mr. One-Man-Show!
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, leave. Fine! [laughs] How will I ever find anyone else who knows how to fill me up with gas?
 Adios, Chuck!
 [angrily]AND MY NAME'S NOT CHUCK!
 Oh, whatever.
 Hey, Lightning! Yo, McQueen, seriously, that was some pretty darn nice racin' out there. [suddenly makes a sudden movie] BY ME! [Chuckles] Welcome to the Chick era, baby! The Piston Cup, it's mine, dude. It's mine. Hey, fellas, how do you think I'm look in Dinoco blue? DINOCO BLUE! [Continues chuckling]
 In your dreams, Thunder.
 Yeah, right. Thunder? What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?
 You know, because thunder always comes after...Lightning! [poses to the crowd] Pew, ka-ka-pow! [to his pitties]
 Who here knew about the thunder thing?
 I didn't.
 [The crowd then tries to take pictures of McQueen posing his flashing bolt sticker to them] Give us the bolt! That's right. Right in the lens. Show me the bolt, baby! Smile, McQueen! Show me the bolt, McQueen! That's it!
 [Electronic music plays as the screen then shows some people entering the Dinoco tent, and some others chattering as they take pictures of the Dinoco Girls on stage. Then it shows Tex Dinoco, The King and Lynda Weathers] Oh, we that was one close finish. You sure made Dinoco proud. Thank you, King.
 Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years. It's the least I could do.
 Whatever happens, you're winner to me, you old daddy rabbit.
 Thanks, dear. We wouldn't be nothing without you.
 I'm Mia.
 I'm Tia.
 We're like your biggest fans! Ka-chow! [they flash McQueen with their headlights]
 I love being me. [Then two police officers come up to move Mia and Tia away.]
 Okay, girls, that's it.
 We love you, Lightning, we love you, more!
 Hey, buddy. You're one gutsy racer.
 Oh, hey, Mr. The King.
 You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.
 Really? Oh, that...
 But you're stupid.
 Excuse me?
 This ain't a one-man deal, kid. You need to wise-up and get yourself a good crew chief and a good team. And you ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, [his voice dwindles as McQueen looks towards the Dinoco stage] and you let them do their job, like they should. Like I tell the boys at the shop...
 [to himself] A good team, Yeah.
 [to McQueen] If you figure that out, you just gonna be, okay?
 [McQueen clears throat] Oh, yeah, that is spectacular advice. Thank you, Mr. The King! Oh!
 [on speakers]Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in Piston Cup history...
 [revving his engine] A rookie has won the Piston Cup. [He then drives through the wallpaper of the stage to the front]YES!!
 [on speakers]...We have a 3-way tie!
 [Laughs] Hey, McQueen, that must be really embarrassing, but I wouldn't be worry about it, because I didn't do it! [laughing]
 Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race between the three leaders will be held in California in one week.
 Well, thank you! Thanks to all of you out there! Thank you! [Whispering to McQueen] Hey, rook, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself. [Screaming to the crowd] No, not me! No, you rock, and you know that!
 Oh, yeah! Whoo!
 [Then it shows McQueen and the whole of in the trailer parking as they go to McQueen's trailer's parking space. Some pities are seen catching some tires being thrown by unseen people, including a Tank Coat pitty named Jerry Drivechain, mimicking Chick] First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself. Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick. [They then come to McQueen's trailer's parking space, but the trailer isn't there.] Huh?
 Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
 I don't want to talk about it. Come on, let's go, Mack. Saddle up. What'd you do with my trailer?
 I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
 What?!
 You gotta make your personal appearance.
 No. No! No, no, no! [The screen then shows a commercial on a TV screen inside the Rust-eze tent,on TV]Yes, yes, yes! Lightning McQueen here. And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula! Nothing soothes rusty bumper like Rust-ezzzzzeeee.[A picture of a Rust-eze container moves across the rear bumper of a rusty car named Jonathan Wrenchworths. As the container moves across, the bumper shines. Text appears saying "Actual results may take up to 36 weeks."]Wow! Look at that shine! Use Rust-eze and you too can look like me! Ka-chow!
 [The commercial ends, and the screen zooms out to show the rusty cars in the Rust-eze tent. On the stage was the founder brothers Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze laughing] I met this car from Swampscott. He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow. [laughs]
 You could see his dirty undercarriage. [He crowd laughs,the screen zooms out to show McQueen and Mack outside the tent entrance which has two McQueen cardboard cut-outs. McQueen was hiding behind one of them]
 [sighs in disgust] I hate rusty cars! This is not good for my image!
 [to McQueen] They did give you your big break. Besides, it's in your contract.
 [to the team, to Mack] Oh, will you stop please? Just go get hooked up.
 Winter is a grand old time.
 Of this there are no ifs or buts. [While Dusty and Rusty were talking, McQueen is hiding behind cardboard cut-outs as they enter the tent]
 But remember, all that salt and grime...
 Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
 [Then the cardboard cut-outs tilt over, exposed McQueen to the rusty cars] Hey, look! There he is! [The rusty cars in the crowd then turn towards McQueen] Our almost champ! Victory ran to your rear end in here, kid.
 Lightning McQueen, you are wicked fast!
 That race was a pisser!
 You were booking, McQueen!
 Give me a little room, guys.
 You're my hero, Mr. McQueen!
 Yes, I know! [laughs as he reads Fred's name on his license plate] Fred, Fred, thank you!
 He knows my name! HE KNOWS MY NAME!
 Looking good, Freddie! [McQueen's and then get on the stage.]
 Thanks to you, Lightning, we had a banner year!
 We might clear enough to buy you some headlights.
 Are you saying he doesn't have headlights?
 That's what I'm telling ya. It's just stickers!
 Well, you know, race cars don't need headlights, because the track is alwayslit.
 Yeah, well, so is my brother, but he still needs headlights! [crowd laughs]
 [Does forced sarcastic laughter]
 Ladies and gentlemen, Lightning McQueen!
Free bird!
 You know, the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment team ran a great race today. And remember, with a little Rust-eze... [McQueen whispering to himself] Well, and an insane amount of luck, [normal voice] you too can look like me... Ka-chow.
 [The rusty cars cheering as McQueen and the whole of go into Mack's trailer] Hey, kid.
 We love ya. And we're looking forward to another great year. Just like this year! [One of the brothers laughs as McQueen poses himself with a smile as the trailer door closes to show a picture of the same pose]
 Not on your life. [Mack then drives away]
 Don't drive like my brother!
 Oh yeah, don't drive like my brother!
 California, here we come!
 Dinoco, here we come.[Life is a Highway plays. McQueen turns on the lights in the trailer. The screen shows all of his different merchandising]
 [Then it shows. The whole song then completely ends as in the evening, that same day, in the trailer it shows McQueen being massaged by brushes as the phone rings.] Oh... Oh, I needed this... [presses a button to respond to the phone call, which makes the brushes go into the roof of the trailer] Hello?
Is this Lightning McQueen, the world's fastest racing machine?
 Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent?
And it is such a honor to be your agent and it almost hurts to take 10% of your winnings and merchandising and ancillary rights in perpetuity anyway. What a race! Huh, champ?! I did-- I didn't see it, but I heard you were great.
 [pressing buttons to change TV channels showing the finish of the previous race] Um... Thanks, Harv.
Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali. I'll pass 'em on to your friends. You shoot me the names. You let Harv rock it for you, alright, baby?
 Right! Friends! Yes, there's, um... [looks toward, who all just shook their heads at him to tell him to not say anything about them at all]
 [to McQueen]Okay, I get it, Mr. Popular, so many friends you can't even narrow it down, hey, when you get to town, you better make time for your best friend, you gotta break bread with your mishpocheh here.
 Yeah, yeah, that would be great! We should totally...
Okay, I gotta jump, kid. L-Let me know how it goes. I'm out.
  What?! A minivan?! [on radio]Oh, come on, Mack, you're in the slow lane, this is Lightning McQueen you're hauling here!
 Just stopping off for a quick breather, kid. Old Mack needs a rest. [starts to go onto the entrance to the Top Down Truckstop where the minivan is going]
Absolutely not. We're driving straight to all night till we get to California, we agreed to it!
 All night?! May I remind you, federal DOT regs sta-
Come on, I need to get there before Chick get hang with Dinoco.
 [sighs as he sees some sleeping trucks] All those sleeping trucks! [on radio]Hey, kid, I don't know if I can make it.
 Oh, sure you can, Mack. Look, it'll be easy, I'll stay up with you!
 [to McQueen]All night?
 All night long.
 Hey, yo, DJ!
 What up?!
 We got ourselves a nodder!
 [chuckles, Boost then drives onto the right lane, while DJ drives onto the middle lane that Mack is on. DJ then plays the song Songbird.]
 Pretty music. [falls asleep and snores]
 Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man! [pushes Mack onto the left lane towards Wingo, pushes Mack back towards Boost]
 [chuckles] Right back at ya! [chuckles]
 Yeah!
 Oops! I missed!
 [dodges in front] You going on vacation?
 [The four cars laugh as Mack, who is still sleeping, moves onto the hard shoulder. The vibration of the hard shoulder causes McQueen to move slowly forward as he is still sleeping and snores. One of McQueen's bobble heads then falls onto a button which opens the trailer's door. The hard shoulder's vibration continues to make, McQueen move forward onto the door which is pressing on the ground and causing sparks. Wingo chuckles, Snot Rod sniffles]
 Oh no, Snot Rod!
 He's gonna blow!
 [DJ, Boost and Wingo then drive away as Snot Rod is still besides Mack and starting to sneeze.] Ah...ah...ah...achoo!!!
 [Snot Rod accelerates away, Mack's wakes up]GESUNDHEIT![Chuckling] One should never drive while drowsy.
 Mack! [Hethen drives back onto the lane, grunting as he drives in front of some traffic honking their horns. McQueen continues driving faster and overtaking some cars while trying to find Mack.] Mack! [He then comes across the queue of trucks and a few cars. He then accelerates faster, trying to find which truck is Mack.] Mack! Hey, Mack! Mack! [He notices a truck exiting the highway onto another road, thinking that it is Mack.] Mack! Mack, wait for me! [His engine is heard revving as he turns onto the same road that the truck is driving along. His tires squeal as he slides onto the road, and he drives along the road with the truck far ahead.] Mack! [The truck, whose face is not seen properly, then crosses a level crossing without barriers. Afterwards, the bell starts to ring as the pair of antique "upper-quadrant" wigwag crossing signals wave. McQueen then notice this and look to their left to see a train coming. McQueen and then go faster as . The train, named notices him and bellows his horn. McQueen get closer and closer to the level crossing. Thanks to good timing, he crosses the level crossing just in time before Trev could hit him.] Mack! Mack! [He then gets closer to the truck, who is slowing down at a 3-way junction.] Mack! Mack... ...wait up! [coughs from the truck's fumes] Mack. Mack! Mack! [He then drive alongside the truck, but its trailer's side shows a sponsor for "Recycled Batteries". The screen then shows the truck, who is actually a Peterbilt named Jerry Recycled Batteries and is not Mack at all.] What? You're not Mack.
 Mack?! I ain't no Mack, I'm a Peterbilt for dang sake! [drives off] Turn on your lights, you moron!
 Mack...the Interstate!
 Not in my town, you don't. [chases after McQueen with his siren wailing]
 [notices Sheriff] Oh, no. Oh, maybe he can help me! [Suddenly, Sheriff is heard backfiring. McQueen thought that Sheriff was shooting at him.] He's shooting at me! Why is he shooting at me?
 [backfiring] I haven't gone this fast in years. [Sheriff grunts as he backfires again] I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.
 Serpentine, serpentine, serpentine!
 [noticing our heroes doing serpentine] What in the blue blazes? Crazy hot-rodder! [he continues chasing McQueen and the whole team as his siren continues wailing.]
 I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower.
 The sixties weren't good to you, were they?
 What? That's not the Interstate! [Suddenly, Sheriff backfires again. He screaming and McQueen's as he hits some traffic cones] Ow, ow, ow, ow! [McQueen then drives off the road, and comes across a giant cone. He screaming and all stopped themselves to watch McQueen go out of control, helpless to stop him. McQueen tires screeching, then drive away across the road. He comes up towards a fence.] No, no, no, no! [He hits the fence, getting it caught on him.] Ow! [McQueen's then heading towards a sign. He screaming and McQueen then drive to the left, heading for Flo's V8 Cafe.]
 I'm not the only one seeing this, right?
 Incoming!
 Whoa, man!
 No! [Sarge, Fillmore and Ramone drive out of the way. The fence hits Ramone's body. Guido hides behind the sign.]
 Hey, you scratch my paint!
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
 My tires!
 Fly away, Stanley, be free![Red gasps as the statue comes towards him, and drives back into the courthouse, the statue lands back in its place, and the water resumes shooting out. Red then looks with shock. The music resumes as Sheriff drives slowly to McQueen who is still hanging from the telephone wires. Sheriff panting heavily.]
 Boy, you're in a heap of trouble. [McQueen sighs and closes his eyes and passed out.]
[The next day, we see photographers at the Los Angeles International Speedway watching Mack arrive.]We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen, is arriving at the track.
 [The photographers are heard talking as they surround Mack.]Is it true he's gonna pose for Car girl? Lightning, what's your strategy?[Mack's trailer door opens, with no one inside it. The all gasping and take pictures with their cameras]
What? Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?
McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing. Race car Lightning McQueen was reported missing. He scheduled to race an unprecedented...[while the screen shows photographers interviewing Dusty and Rusty Rust-eze]Sponsor stated they have no idea where he is.
I just hope Lightning's okay, I sure hate to see anything bad happen to him.
I don't know what's harder to find, Lightning green or a crew chief who'll work for him!
 [German accent]Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!
They're all asking the same question: Where is McQueen?
 [The screen shows McQueen sleeping in the Radiator Springs Municipal Impound that morning as he starts to regain consciousness.] [McQueen sighs] Oh, boy. Oh... Where am I?
 Morning,Sleeping Beauty!
[wakes up immediately] Ah!
Ha, ha! Boy, I was wondering when you’re gonna wake up!
 Take whatever you want! Just don't hurt me! [McQueen tries to reverse, then he felt a bump and heard a thud. He notices a parking boot on his tire, which it moves ahead as his tire was moving backwards.] A parking boot? Why do I have a parking boot on? [The screen zooms out to show Lightning McQueen in the impound.] What are you—— What's going on here? Please!
 [McQueen tries to push the parking boot back, but it wouldn't go underneath his tire. Materchuckles] You're funny, I like you already. My name's Mater.
 Mater?
 Yeah, like "tuh-mater", but without the "tuh".  What's your name?
 Y—— You don't know my name?
 Nuh… No, I know your name. Is your name "Mater",  too?
 What? Look, I need to get to California as fast as possible. Where am I?
 Where are you? Shoot! You're in Radiator Springs! The cutest little town in Carburetor County.
 [looks around to see a few old buildings]Oh, great. Just great!
 Well, if you think that's great, you should see the rest of the town.
 You know? I'd love to see the rest of the town. So if you could just open the gate, take this boot off, you and me, we go cruising, check out the local scene, you know?
 [he smiles]Dad-gum! [gets ready to press the button to open the gate]
 How'd that be, Tow Mater?
 Cool! [about to press the button]
 Mater! [Mater then stops, and reverses as Sheriff arrives. McQueen then frowns, and some members of then feel sorry for Mater while some of them look confused.] What did I tell you about talking to the accused?
 To not to.
 [presses the button to open the gate] Well, quit yer yapping and tow this delinquent road hazard to traffic court.
 [Mater whispering to McQueen] Well, we'll talk later, Mater. [chuckles as he gets behind McQueen] "Later, Mater." That's funny! [McQueen screams. Heuses his tow hook to grab McQueen's undercarriage]
 Ah!
 [Then the screen skips to show the Radiator Springs Courthouse & Fire Department from outside as Sheriff's voice is heard.] The Radiator Springs Traffic Court will come to order!
 [Then the screen shows inside the building as McQueen and the whole team enter the courtroom, which most of the other Radiator Springs residents were inside and were angry with McQueen for what he have done.] Hey, you scratched my paint! I ought take a blowtorch to you, man!
 [Then the screen shows McQueen as he moves his tire up while getting pushed by Mater into the courtroom to the accused space while the team followed him.] You broke-a the road! You a very bad car!
 Fascist!
 Commie!
McQueen [to Sheriff] Officer, talk to me, babe. How long is this gonna take? I gotta get to California, pronto.
 Where's your lawyer?
 [scoffs] I don't know. Tahiti maybe. He's got a timeshare there.
 When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him. [to the other residents] Hey! Anyone want to be his lawyer? [All of the residents move back, except Mater.]
 Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!
 All rise! The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.
 [Ramone moves his body up from his tires] Show Off.
 May Doc have mercy on your soul.
 Alright, I wanna know who's responsible for wrecking my town, Sheriff. I wanna his hood on a platter! I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots! No, check that. [McQueen gulps. He gets on some ramps that move him up to the top of his bench] I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him, and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot. I'm-- [notices McQueen and the team, as McQueen does a nervous grin] Throw him out of here, Sheriff. I want him out of my courtroom. I want him out of our town! Case dismissed.
 Yes!
 Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyerin' stuff.
 [Then the door opens as Sally Carrera appears.] Sorry, I'm late,your honor!
 [McQueen and turn around to see her, which McQueen instantly falls in love with her.] [to himself McQueen whispers]Holy porsche! She's gotta be from my attorney's office! [Sally then drives into the courtroom as our heroes turn back to the front.] [to Sally] Hey, thanks for coming, we're all set. He's letting me go.
 [stops, and turns to McQueen] He's letting you go?
 Yeah, your job's pretty easy today. All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you. Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase. Me, you, dinner. [reflects sunlight on his bolt sticker] Pi-cha-kow! [The reflected sunlight shines on Sally's eyes; Sally groans, grunts] Ta-chow! Ah...! I know, I get that reaction a lot. I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand. [stops reflecting sunlight, revs his engine. Sally groans] Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
 Well, a little bit, but I'll be alright.
 Okay, I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
 Do what you gotta do, baby. Oh, but listen, be careful. Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean.
 [Then we see Mater, who is trying to reflect sunlight on his wing mirror like what McQueen did with his bolt sticker earlier.] Ka-ching! [Then the sunlight goes into his eyes.] [Mater groans]
 [to McQueen] I'll keep that in mind. [to Mater] Hey, there, Mater.
 Howdy, Sally. [Then McQueen's smile turn to frown.]
 Hi, folks! [to the other Radiator Springs residents, drives to Doc]
 Good morning, Sally!
 [to Mater] Do you know her?
 She's the town attorney and my fiancee.
 What?
 [chuckling, smacks McQueen with his tire] I'm just kidding, she just like me for my body.
 Doc, you look great this morning! Did you do something different with your side view mirrors?
 What do you want, Sally?
 [Sally sighs] Come on, make this guy fix the road. The town needs this.
 No. I know his type. Race car. That's the last thing this town needs.
 Okay, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc. But you leave me no choice. [to the other citizens] Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history.
 [to himself] Here she goes again.
 Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road! It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers on our stretch of that road.
 [in voice] Travelers? Whattravelers?
 [in voice] Ignore him.
 But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers if there is no road for them to drive on? [to Luigi] Luigi, what do you have at your store?
 Tires.
 And if no one can get to you?
 I won't sell any.... tires. I will lose everything! [cries]
 Flo, what do you have at your store?
 I have gas. Lotsa gas! [Mater and Ramone laugh on a joke with gasoline and gas from farts]
 Okay, boys, stay with me. And, and, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?
 I'll go outta business and we'll have to leave town!
 And what's gonna happen to all of us if Flo leaves town and closes her station?
 Without gas, we're done for!
 What?
 So, don't you think the car responsible should fix our road?
 The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al!
 Lizzie, the guy left, like, 15 years ago.
 Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon?
 Oh, he can do it. He's got the horsepower. So, what do you want him to do?
 Fix the road!
 Because we are a town worth fixing!
 Yeah! [all cheering]
 [honks his own horn, which represents banging a hammer, angrily] Order in the court! Seems like my mind has been changed for me.
 Yeah!
No!
 Nice ruling.
 [groans to Sally] I am so not take you to dinner.
 [giggles] That's OK, Stickers. You can take Bessie.
 Oh, man, you got to work with Bessie, I'd give my left 2-Lug Nuts for something like that.
 Bessie? Who's Bessie?
 This here is Bessie, finestRoad-Paving Machineever built. [to McQueen] I'm hereby sentencing you to community service. You're gonna fix the road under my supervision.
 What?! This place is crazy!
 [whispers to McQueen] Hey, I know this may be a bad time right now, but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees.
 What?
 [to McQueen] So we're gonna hitch you up to sweet Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice.
 You've gotta be kidding me!
 [to McQueen] You start there where the road begins, [drives to where the road begins from the courthouse] you finish down there where the road ends.
 [Mater and the team get onto the road, facing towards the end of the town, and has a long swirly crack. McQueen moves his tire up, and moves himself forward so he can move with his parking boot still on. Mater looks at the damaged road] Holy shoot!
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! How long is this gonna take?
 Well, fella does it right, should take him about 5 days.
 5 days? But I should be in California schmoozingDinocoright now!
 Then if I were you, I'd quit yapping and start working! Hook him up, Mater.
 Okay-dokey. [Mater tries to get McQueen's parking boot off as watched him do that. Mater groaning. Finally, McQueen's boot comes off. Suddenly, he quickly drives away and into the distance.]
 Freedom!!!
 [Doc and the whole team crossly looked at Mater, who was shocked.] Maybe I should've, uh, hooked him up to Bessie... and then, uh... then took the boot off. [looks at the team]
 Whoo-hoo! Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie! California, here I come! Yeah! Oh, fell that wind! Yes! [But then, his engine starts sputtering.] No, no, no, no, no! Outta gas? How can I be outta gas?
 [He stopped near the other billboard, where Sheriff and Sally are.] [laughs] Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are.
 [sputtering] But, but, but how did...? How did--? You--?
 We siphoned your gas while you were passed out. [reflects sunlight on her wing mirror] Ka-chow!
[The light hits McQueen in the eye] Ow, ow, ow, ow! [He then frowns as Sheriff laughs.]
 [The screen shows the traffic light, as its amber light continues blinking. Then we see Sheriff driving to Flo's V8 Cafe, where Fillmore and Sarge are standing.] Gentlemen.
 [The gas station bell dings.] Sheriff.
 Hey, Sheriff.
 [Then the screen shows Luigi and Guido at Luigi's Casa Della Tires as they are arguing about where some tires were put at the moment and before. Red is watering some flowers there.] Why the tires are here?
 [speaking Italian]Sono sempre stati qui.
 They were better well before.
 Stai sempre a parlare.
 Guido!
 [to Red] Red, can you move over? I want to get look at that sexy hot rod.
 [While Lizzie was talking, Red stops watering. Then we see McQueen pulling Bessie slowly along the road between the many old closed shops, laying out tar behind Bessie. Mater was standing on the sidewalk and the whole of are with him.] You know, I used to be a purty good whistler. I can't do it now of course, on account of sometimes I get fluid built up in my engine block, but Doc said he's gonna fix it dough. He can fix about anything. That's why we made him the judge. Boy, you shoulda heard me on"giddy-up, oom papa mow mow."Now, I'm not one to brag, but people come purty far to see me get low on themow-mow.
 [Then a bubble of tar comes out from one of Bessie's pipes, pops, and a little slob of tar lands on McQueen's right bolt sticker.] Ah! Aw, man, that's just great!
 Hey, what's wrong?
 [disgusted] My lucky sticker's all dirty.
 [groans] That ain't nothing, I'll clean it for you! [Mater snorts, and hacks]
 No, no, no, no, no! That won’t be necessary. [notices Red the fire truck, who was watering the same flowers at Luigi's store] Hey! Hey, big fella! Yeah, you in the red! [sees McQueen, and stops watering] I could use a little hose down. Help me wash this off. [But Red instead leaves nervously, pushing the flowers away.] Where’s he going?
 Oh, he's still a little bit shy, and he hates you for killin' his flowers.
 I shouldn't have to put up with this. I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics.
 You hurt your what?
 I’m a very famous race car!
 You are a famous race car? A real race car?
 Yes, I'm a real race car. What do you think? Look at me.
 I have followed racing my entire life, my whole life!
 Then you know who I am. I'm Lightning McQueen.
 Lightening McQueen?!
 Yes! Yes!
 I must scream it to the world! My excitement from the top of someplace very high! Do you know many Ferraris?
 No, no, no, no. They race on the European circuit. I'm in the Piston Cup! [Then we see Luigi and Guido, who are now frowning.] What?
 Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
 Is that what I think it is? [the camera then shows Van and Minny in the distance, driving towards the town.]
 Customers. Customers!Customers, everyone! Customers!Okay...
 Customers?
 [Then, as Sally is talking, we see Luigi and Guido hearing Sally and are glad. Ramone then moves his body up. Mater gasps and drives to the CROSSROAD. Sarge and Fillmore start driving to their stores.] All right, everybody calm down, it's been a long time. Just remember what we rehearsed. Make sure your "Open, please come in" signs are out. And you all know what to do. All right, nobody panics, here we go! (drives towards Van and Minny. The camera then shows Van and Minny driving along the road, as they are lost trying to find the interstate.)
 Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere.
 Minny, I knowexactlywhere we are.
 Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.
 Honey, please.
 Hello. Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley. Legendary for it's quality service and friendly hospitality. How can we help you?
 We don't need anything, thank you very much.drives past Sally, to Van
 Whoa, honey, ask her direction to the interstate. [drives along, while Sally follows. As Van and Minny drive along the ROAD, they drive alongside the bumps caused by Stanley's sp they don't get flat tires statue.]
 There's no need to ask for directions. Minny, I know exactly where we're going.
 [to Sally] He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee. You know, we were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we...
 [chuckles] Okay, okay. Really. We're just peachy, okay?
 What youreallyneed is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel.
 [chuckles] No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
 We're just trying to find the interstate!
 Good to see you, soldier! Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for all your government surplus needs.
 Oh, honey, surplus
 I think we have too much surplus.
 I do have a map over the Cozy Cone Motel. And if you do stay, we offer a free Lincoln continental breakfast.
 Honey, she's got a map!
 I don't need a map, I have the GPS. Never need a map again, thank you!
 How 'bout somethin' to drink? Stop at Flo's V8 Cafe. Finest fuel on Route 66.
 No, we just top off.
juggles tires while Luigi is talking, and ends with most of them in a pile with one standing up on topAnd if you need tires, stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires, home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.
 We're just trying to find the interstate.
 But you do need a paint job man. Ramone will paint you up right. 'Ay! Anything you want! You know, like a flame job!
 No, thanks.
 Maybe gold flames? You like old school pinstripin'? Von Dutch style, huh?lifts his rear end up in front in Van and Minny gasping in pure shock
 Oh, honey! Look! Von Dutch!
 [laughs] Okay, no.chuckles, and starts to drive away along with MinnyWe're gonna be going now, OKAY then Lizzie puts a bumper sticker attached to her tire onto Van's rear bumper. Van grunts and turns around towards Lizzie]
 [laughing] A little somethin' to remember us by!
 [laughs] Okay! [drives away along with Minny]
 Come back soon, okay? I mean, you know where we are! [giggles] Tell your friends!
 [Then the camera does a close-up of the bumper sticker, which shows Willy's Butte and a message saying "Nice Butte - Radiator Springs", and zooms out.]Van[chuckles] Okay yes. You bet.
 Thanks again, folks. Bye-bye now.
 Psst. Psst. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I know how to get to the interstate!
 Oh, do ya?
 Minny, no.
 Yeah, yeah,yeah. No, not really. But listen. I'm Lightning McQueen, the famous race car. I'm being held here against my will. [Van then grins as Minny smiles at McQueen.] And I need you to call my team, so they can rescue me, and get me to California in time for me to win The Piston Cup. Do you understand?
 No, no, no, no, no! No, it's the truth! I'm telling you! You gotta help me!Don't leave me here!I'm in hillbilly hell!! My IQ's dropping by the second!!!I’m becoming ONE OF THEM!!!
 [Van and Minny disappear as McQueen's yelling is echoed. Sally sighs, and then talks to the other residents] Okay, don't worry. They know where we are now. They're gonna tell their friends. You'll see.
And we'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon...
 That's good. [as the other residents drive away]
 [through the radio]...after a Piston Cup update. Still no sign of Lightning McQueen. Meanwhile, Chick Hicks arrived in California and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track.
 [through the radio]Yeah, well it's just nice to get out here before the other competitors. You know, get a head start. Gives me an edge.
 Yeah! Hey, McQueen... Eat your heart out.
 [Then McQueen's daydream ends as the screen shows the present day. McQueen gasps] Oh! Mater, let me get this straight. I can go when this road is done. That's the deal, right?
 That's what they done did said.
 Okay, outta my way. I got a road to finished. [The screen then zooms in on two "End Construction Zone" signs in the distance. McQueen grunts and revs his engine. McQueen starts to move at his normal speed. Bits of tar come out of Bessie as McQueen drives faster. Mater and the whole of are then shocked at seeing him move.]
 [Then the camera shows inside Doc Hudson's office as Mater comes in] He's done!
 Done?
 [nobs his face] Ahmhm.
 It's only been an hour.
 I'm done. Look, I'm finished. Just say thank you, and I'll be on my way. That's all I gotta say.
 [Then the camera moves up into the air and shows the new road which now looks incredibly bumpy and sloppy. Mater is seen beside it in the distance.] Whoo-hoo! I'm the first one on the new road! Uh, oh—— [drives onto the road, and vibrates as he moves over the bumpy tar, and several objects fall off him] It rides purty smooth. [continues vibrating]
 It looks awful!
 Well, it matches the rest of the town.
Oh!
[starts crying] Bah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
 Red?
 Who do you think you are?
 [rudely] Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go. That was the deal.
 [driving up] The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse. Now, scrape it off! Start over again.
 Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a race car.
 Oh, ho, ho! Is that right? Then why don't we just have a little race? Me and you.
 What?
 [chuckles] Me and you. Is that a joke?
 If you win, you go and I fix the road. If I win, you do the road my way.
 Doc, what're you doin'?
 [laughs] I don't mean to be rude here Doc, but you probably go zero to sixty in like what? Three-point-five years?
 Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
 You know what old timer? That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.
 Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race. You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back. There will be no bumpin', no cheatin', no spittin', no bittin', no road rage, no maimin', no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin', no backstabbin', no road-hoggin' and no lollygaggin'.
 [whispering to Mater] Speed. I'm speed. Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer.
 [laughing] My friend Guido, he dream to give a real race car a pit stop!
 [turns up] Pit stop!
 [groans, chuckles] The race is only one lap, guys. Uno lappo! [Luigi's smile then turns to a frown, while Guido is still shaking happily.] Don't need any help. I work solo mio.
 Fine. Race your way. [drives away to join the others, Guido is still standing there shaking happily.]
 No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
 Okay. [drives away to join the others]
 Gentlemen... Start your engines!
 Hijole! Check that out!
 Whoa.
 Emm, emm.
 Great idea, Doc. Now the road will never get done.
 Luigi? [then he joins the others as Luigi drives onto the road with his Ferrari flag to start the race.]
 [chuckling] On your mark, get set. Uno for the money, due for the show, tre to get ready, and quattro to... [While Luigi is talking, the screen does a closeup of McQueen and Doc's eyes. McQueen's eyes move towards Doc, whose eyes look furious. Luigi as McQueen revs his engine] I can't believe it... [waves his flag] Go!! [McQueen then starts off, and races towards Willy's Butte and leaving a pile of dust. Luigi laughs]
 Yee ha! Ha ha ha!
 Yeah.
 Huh? [As the dust clears, we see that Doc is still there, not moving.] Doc, the flag means go. Remember the flag. Here we go. Go. [But Doc is still not moving.]
 Um... Doc, what are you doing, man?
 Oh, dear. It would seem I'm off to a poor start. Well, better late than never. Come on, Mater. Might need a little help.
 Um, okay. [drives alongside Doc]
 You got your tow cable?
 [showing his tow cable] Well, yeah. I always got my tow cable. Why?
 Oh, just in case.
 [screams]AH,OW, OW, OW, OW,NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!!![hits the cacti]
 Oh, man! Ow!
 Whoa. Bad trip, man.
 [McQueen tries to reverse out of the cactus, but he couldn't budge. Then Doc and Mater turn up to the cliff.] Hey! Was that floating like a Cadillac, or was that stinging like a Beemer? I'm confused.
Mater [chuckles]
 You drive like you fix roads. [McQueen's angry frown] Lousy! [to Mater] Have fun fishing, Mater. [drives off]
 [Mater swings his tow cable, and throws his hook towards McQueen, which it grabs onto his rear end. McQueen gasps and Mater then pulls McQueen out of the cactus.]
 I'm startin' to think he knowed you was gonna crash!
 [as he gets pulled up the side of the valley] Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
 I can make a little turn on dirt. You think? [grunts as he scrapes another bit of tar] No. And now I'm a day behind. I'm never gonna get outta here!
 Hey,ese! You need a new paint job, man!
 No, thank you.
 How 'bout some organic fuel?
 That freak juice?
 Pass.
 Whoo! Watchin' him workin' is makin' me thirsty. [to Mater] Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
 Nah, not me, Flo. I'm on one of them there special diets. [a few bits of spit comes out of him as he says "special"] I'm a precisional instrument of speed and air-matics.
 "You race like you fix roads." [groaning] I'll show him. [groaning again] I will show him! [Then the screen shows at night time as Doc drives towards his building named Doctor Hudson: Dr. of Internal Combustion. He then looks to the right, which we see McQueen pulling Bessie at the start, while Sheriff is watching him with his magnetic beacon on. Laughing sounds are made by Bessie's engine as tar splats on McQueen shaking the tar off in anger] Aw, great!! I hate it!! Hate, hate, hate, hate it!!!
 [chuckles] Music. Sweet music. [drives into his building]
 Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
 [angrily] Radiator Springs, a happy place!!
 [clucking] [Sally drives into her building at the Cozy Cone Motel as the rest of all go into their tents to try to get some sleep despite fart noises and McQueen's very loud complaining]
 [Then another slop of tar lands on McQueen, ragefully] Whoa, okay, Bessie you think that's funny?! GREAT!! I'M TALKIN' TO BESSIE NOW!! I'M TALKIN' TO BESSIE!!!
 [Then the screen shows the next morning, and moves down to Sally exiting her building and the whole of all coming out of their tents, all dressed in their regular outfits. Then, they all hear Mater, who is heard laughing and cheering.]
 Wow! [She and the team then went to the crossroad, to which it is then shown that there is flat tarmac on the part of the road from the courthouse to the end of the crossroad. Mater driving around on the tarmac]
 Mornin', Sally! Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!
 Yes! Ahmm. Amazing! [Luigi and Guido are also seen, impressed at the new tarmac. Then we see Ramone, who has changed his paint from purple to green. Ramone driving on the new tarmac, lifts his front up]
 Yeah! [sighs and moves his front back down]
 Oh, Ramone, Mama ain't seen you that low in years.
 I haven't seen a road like this in years.
 Well, then let's cruise, baby.
 Low and slow.
 [speaking Italian]E Bellissima! It's beautiful! Guido, look, it's a like it was paved by angels. Oh!!
 Oh, I tell you what. I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth.
 Doc, look at this! Should a tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh?
 Well, he ain't finished yet. Still got a long way to go.
 Guido, look at Luigi! [Mater lets go, and Luigi slides across the tarmac at the crossroad. Luigi driving back and forth once across the tarmac, Luigi chuckling] This is fantastico!
 That looks like fun! Mater, I got dibs, next turn!
 Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump.
 [groans] That crazy old devil woman. [sighs as he and Guido get shocked at the look of their store] She's right!
 [shrieks and sliding along the tarmac and back the other way]
 Guido!
 Huh! That punk actually did a good jab. [noticing Bessie on the other road] Well, now... where the hack is he? [Then the screen shows Lightning McQueen in the desert driving on the same dirt road used for the race track. Doc then comes to Sheriff, who was watching McQueen.] Sheriff! Is he making another run for it?
 No, no. He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night, asked me if he could come down here. All he's trying to do is make that there turn.
 [slides off the track and onto the dirt]NO NO NO NO!!Aw, great! [Doc laughs and driving back onto the track] Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.
 Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's. I'll keep an eye on him.
 Well, thanks, Doc. I've been feeling a quart low. [drives back to Radiator Springs]
 AAH!!!!!
 This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
 Oh, great. What do you want? You hear to gloat? [drives past slowly]
 You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle. Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips.
 [turns around] So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert.
 I'll put it simple. If you goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right.
 Ooh, right, that makes perfect sense. Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you! Or should I say, "No thank you"? [mockingly] Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, "Thank you"! [his smile turns to a frown, then he starts his engine and drives off, McQueen scoffs] Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
 [groans as he then drives away slowly back to Radiator Springs]
 Turn right to go left. [to Doc, drives away slowly back to Radiator Springs] Mm... [He moves his front wheels right, but he then suddenly went right.] Oh! [He then drives off the side, stays still in midair for a second, and falls down into the valley.] Whoa! [The car crashes on cactuses] Ow! Oh, that-- [Then a saguaro cactus falls and crashes on top of McQueen.]Owwwwwwwwww!!!
 Turn right to go left. Guess what. I tried it. You know what? This crazy thing happened... I went right!
 You keep talking to yourself, people'll think you crazy!
 Thanks for the tip.
 What? I wasn't talking to you!
 Oh, Guido,e bellissimo!
Che cosa?
 It looks great! This is great!
Ah, ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.
 [groans as he pulls his sign upright, then passes gas] Oh, Lord! [Then the sign tilts to the other side. Mater laughs]HUH?!
 Mater?! I need you to watch the prisoner tonight.
 Well,Dad Gum! Wait a minute, what if he tries to run again?
 Just let him run outta gas and tow him on back. But keep an eye on him.
 Yes, sir! [closes one eye, and keeps the other open] Unh!
 While I'm stuck here paving this stinking road, Chick's in California schmoozing dinoco. My dinoco! [feels something]WHOA WHOA WHOA! Who's touching me?! [Guido then pops up beside him. He was spinning each of McQueen's tires to get the cactus bits off them, and uses a spray can on the tires.]
 You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix. You make a such a nice new road. You come to my shop. Luigi take a good care of you. Even though you not a Ferrari. [to McQueen] You buy four tires, I give you a full size spare absolutely free!
 Look, I get all my tires for free.
 [chuckles and gasps] I like your style, Eu? You drive the hard bargain. Okay, Luigi make you a new deal. You buy one tire, I give you three for free! [The screen shows Sally watching them, then she turns around to see Flo amazed with Ramone cleaning a fence around a house beside Ramone's House of Body Art.]
 Aw... Would you look at that? Ramone, Ramone!
 [chuckles]
 Then Luigi make you a new deal.
 No, no, no, no. Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you. [The screen then shows McQueen, Luigi, Guido.]
 No, no, no, no, no. This is it, my last offer. You buy one tire, I give you 7-a snow tire for all free! Done. You interested, you call me. You know where I am.
 Stop! Let me--! [Then the water stops, as McQueen coughs. The screen then turns around to show Sally Carrera and Red, who was shooting water at McQueen to get him clean.]
 [noticing a cactus piece on McQueen's hood] Oh, Red! You missed a spot, see it right there? On the hood right there.
 No, no!
 NO!! Stop, stop! That cold!!! Help, please, stop! [Finally, the cactus piece comes off, and Red stops. McQueen coughs and sputters]
 Thanks, Red. [Red then leaves.]
 What was that for?!
 Do you wanna stay at the Cozy Cone or what?
 Huh?
 And if you do, you gotta be clean. 'Cause even here in hillibilly hell we have standards.
 What, I--? I don't get it.
 Nothing I just thought I'd say thank you for doing a great job. So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me! But there. Not with me there, but there in your own Cozy Cone. And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
 Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
 I mean if you want to stay at the dirty impound, thats, thats fine. You know, I understand you criminal types.
 No, no, no, no. That's okay. Yeah, the Cozy Cone. [looks at the Cozy Cone Motel]
 Eu, it's newly refurbished.
 [chuckles] Yeah, it's like a clever little twist the motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars usually try to avoid, now we're gonna stay in them. [chuckles] That's funny.
 Figure that all out on your own, did you? [reverses and turns around, drives back to the motel] Cone number one, if you want.
 [groans and notices a tattoo on Sally Carrera's back] Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?
 OH! [turns around and giggles, then reverses] That's just a-- [bumps into a pile of cones, with one on her roof] OH! [McQueen and Sally laughing] Oh, you saw that? [giggles] Yeah! Just gonna be going. [reverses to the door of the building] Gonna... [the cone on her roof comes off as it hits the door] Yeah. [McQueen then grins. The screen then zooms out to show Mater next to them.]
 [McQueen gasps as Mater starts talking] You know, I once knew this girldoreen. Good-looking girl! Looked just like ajaguar, only she was a truck! You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her!
 What are you talking about?
 I don't know. Hey, I know something we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watching you!
 No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here.
 Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt. You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
 Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater. You know who you're talking to? This is Lightning McQueen. I can handle anything.
 [Whispers] Mater, I'm not doing this.
 Oh, come on, you'll love it! [Materchuckles. The screen then shows a field full of sleeping tractors.] Tractor-tippin's fun!
 [Tractors snoring] This is ridiculous.
 [to McQueen] Alright, listen, when I say go, we go, but don't let Frank catch you,GO![drives towards the field]
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, Wait, Wait! W--Wh--Who's Frank? [Mater continues driving, and enters the field. McQueen whispering] Mater! Wait, Mater! [McQueen and the whole team then follow Mater.]
 Okay, here's what you do, you just sneak up in front of them, and then honk? And they do the rest. Watch this. [tiptoes towards a tractor, and honks his horn loudly. Tractor 1 wakes up. Leans up and moos, then lands on its back. Then gas is heard sloshing, and the tractor backfires, which it sounded like farting. Mater laughs loudly]
 I swear, tractors is so dumb! I tell you what, buddy, you don't get much better than this.
 Yep, you're living the dream, Mater boy.
 I don't care who you are, that's funny right there. [to the team, to McQueen] Ah, you turn, bud.
 Mater, I can't. I don't even have a horn.
 Baby?
 I'm not a baby!
 [clucking]
 [to Mater] Fine. Stop, Stop, Okay? Alright, I'll do something.
 ... That's Frank. [drives away, while our heroes are standing still]
 [scared] Ahhhhhhh!
 RUN!!! [continues laughing. Then the screen zooms out to show them heading towards the fence. Our heroes then turn to the left as Frank continues chasing them. Frank roaring, Mater laughing. Frank is then seen from his side as he gains on McQueen and the team.] Run, he's gonna get ya! [The screen then shows from our heroes' point of view as they all come towards another end of the field where there was one piece in the fence, and the whole team drive through it. McQueen screams and Frank stops as he comes towards the edge of the field, and McQueen and the whole team stop and then drive away on the road with Mater back to Radiator Springs. Mater laughing]
 [Then the screen shows Sally inside the Cozy Cone Motel. Shadows then appear moving on the wall. Sally gasping and notices the shadows] Customers! [drives towards the door, turns on the neon lights, and notices a light saying "no" going off and coming back on, turns the lights off, turns the lights on again, but the "no" light was on before and turned off when the other lights turned on. Then we see Mater, McQueen and in the distance driving, walking and fluttering along the road.]
 Tomorrow night we can go look for the ghost light!
 I can't wait, Mater.
 Oh, yeah, I'm telling you! [As Mater talks, the screen shows Sally, who notices them, sighs, grins and drives back into the building. Then the screen shows Mater, McQueen and the team again.] Oh, boy, you gotta admit that was fun!
 Oh, Yeah Yeah.
 Well, we better get you back to the impound lot.
 You know, actually, Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.
 Aw. Getting cozy at the Cone, is we?
 Oh, co-No, No, Are you kidding? Besides, she can't stand me. [McQueen scoffs] And I don't like her, to be honest.
 Yeah, you probably right: "HEY, LOOK, THERE'S MISS SALLY!"
 [looking around] Where-Where?!
 [laughing] [McQueen groans] You're in love with Miss Sally!
 [As our heroes are talking, Sally then turns to see them from inside the building, irritatedly] No, I'm not.
 Yes, you do.
 No way.
 Way.
 Come on, look...
 [turns around and drives backwards] You're in love with Miss Sally! You're in love with Miss Sally!
 Okay, that's real mature Mater, real grown up.
 You love her! You love her, you love her! You love her, You love her, You love her!
 Wait... Alright, okay, Mater, Mater, Mater, no! [Mater laughs and noticing Mater driving backwards] Will you stop that?!
 Stop what?
 That's driving backwards stuff. It's creeping me out. You're gonna wreck on something.
 [stops moving] Wreck?! Shoot, I'm the world's best backwards driver! You just watch this right here, lover boy. [drives backwards with his lights on, drives towards one of the Cozy Cones]
 What are you doing?! Watch out, Look out! Mater?! [Mater then drives around the cone.] Mater! [Mater laughs as he drives around a few more cones] Mater! [Sally watches as Mater drives around the building. Finally, Mater drives backwards onto the desert ground, stops, and starts spinning.] Hey, take it easy, Mater!
 [screams happily. Then Mater stops spinning, and drives backwards into the forest, laughing. Mater grunting and blubbering, and jumps high up into the air in front of the full orange Moon]
 [Laughs] He's nuts!
 [driving back to McQueen and while still going backwards] No need to watch where I'm goin'! [jumps and turns around as he stops in front of McQueen] Just need to know where I've been. [turns his lights off]
 Whoa, that was incredible! How'd you do that?
 Rear view mirrors. We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want.
 [chuckles] Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race. [drives along]
 What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?
 [stops moving, and turns around] It's not just a race. We're talking about the Piston Cup! I've been dreaming about it my whole life! I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it. And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters. No more medicated bumper ointment. No more rusty old cars.
 What's wrong with rusty old cars?
 Well, I don't mean you, Mater. I mean other old cars. You know? Not like you. I like you.
 Nah, it's okay, buddy. [to McQueen] Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters? I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of them fancy helicopters.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
 You mean it?
 Oh, yeah. Anything you say.
 I knew it. I knowed I made a good choice!
 In what?
 My best friend.
 See you tomorrow, buddy! [Mater then turns on his lights, swings his hook, and drives backwards around McQueen and back to his home. Mater singing as he drives backwards]McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree, K-I-S-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-T!
[McQueen laughs. Then the team walk, flutter and drive toward the Cozy Cones, as McQueen tries to go backwards and looks behind.] Whoa, whoa, whoa. [We then see Sally as she watches them all going to their Cozy Cones.] Now then... [looks around to find his cone] Number 1, number 1! [finds Cone number one] Oh, Number 1! [drives into the cone and looks around as Sally comes to him.] Ha, this is nice.
 Hey, Stickers! [McQueen screams and Sally shrieks] I'm sorry!
 [turns around] WHOA! You scared me, you gotta be careful.
 I scared myself scaring you scaring me.
 I mean, I wasn't like "scared" scared.
 No, of course not. Not.
 I was more...
 Just I overheard you talking to Mater.
 When? Just, just now? What, what did, what did you hear?
 Oh, just something about a helicopter ride.
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got a kick out of that, didn't he?
 Did you mean it?
 What?
 That you'll get him a ride.
 Oh, who knows? I mean first things first. I gotta get outta here and make the race.
 Uh-huh. You know Mater trusts you.
 Yeah, okay.
 Did you mean that?
 What?
 Was it just a "Yeah, okay", or "Yeah...okay" or "Yea-yeah, okay"?
 Look, I'm exhausted. It's kinda been a long day.
 Yeah, okay. Good night. [turns around and drives back to the building]
 [McQueen grunts as he remembers what asked him to do] Ah... Hey, thank you.
 [Sally then stops, and turns around.] What did you just say?
 You know, thanks for letting me stay here. It's nice to be out of the impound, and this is... It's great. Newly refurbished, right?
 Yeah.
 Good night.
 Good night. [drives back to her building, Sally giggles. Then McQueen presses a button to close the door on the cone.]
 [salutes with his antenna. Then Sarge's bugle reveille gets angry and interrupted by Jimi Hendrix's rendition of "The Star-Strangled Banner" being put on by Fillmore.]Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!
 Respect the classics, man. It's Hendrix!
NO![gasping] [Then an alarm beeps as a model car pops in and out of a miniature cone alarm clock.]I gottagetouttahere! Hey, have you seen the Sheriff? [The screen shows inside Doc Hudson's building as McQueen and come in, notices Sheriff's rear, as Sheriff is on a ramp up in the air] Oh! Oh, my gosh. Oh!
 [The screen turns around as it shows that Doc Hudson was sorting something on Sheriff's undercarriage. Doc turns around] Hey, what are you doing?!
 Get a good peak, City Boy?
 [Stutters] I, a.. a.. I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
 [angrily] Wait for him at Flo's! Now get outta here!
 I’ve been trying to get out of here for three days! [McQueen then leaves the building.]
 Hope you enjoyed the show. [McQueen grunts in anger as he kicks a can, which goes into a garage in the side of Doc Hudson's building, and we hear the sounds of objects falling down. McQueen and the team stop moving as they hear this. McQueen groans. Then the screen shows inside the garage as McQueen opens the doors, and he and the whole of enter. McQueen notices all of the boxes on the floor beside him]
 [Chuckling] Whoa ho, Doc. Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on. [Then our heroes notice something near the window. They turn towards it, and it turns out to be a Piston Cup trophy. They look up to see that the text on the bottom says "Hudson Hornet, Champion, 1951".] What? He has a Piston Cup? [Then they look to see another Piston Cup trophy behind a few boxes. They push the boxes aside, and see a third trophy as well along with four old racing tires with red hubcaps.] Oh, my gosh. Three Piston Cups? [They look at the text on the two trophies, which say that Doc was the champion of 1952 and 1953. Then they look to see a newspaper beside saying "Third Piston Cup Win! Hudson Hornet champion for all time" and showing a picture of Doc with the racing number 51 and the text "Fabulous Hudson Hornet" and a few other decals.]
 [bitterly]Sign says stay out! [McQueen gasps upon hearing Doc's voice]
 [They all reverse and see Doc standing grumpily outside the door.]You You've three Piston Cups. How could you have--? [Doc drives in]
 [bitterly] I knew you couldn't drive. I didn't know you couldn't read. [as Doc pushes our heroes outside]
 You're the Hudson Hornet!
 [angrily] Wait over at Flo's, like I told you!!
 Of course. I can't believe I didn't see it before! You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet! You still to hold the record for most wins in single season! Oh, we gotta talk. You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
 [bitterly] I already tried that.
 And you won the championship three times! Look at those trophies!
 [bitterly] You look. All I see is a bunch of empty cups. [closes the doors. McQueen frowns]
 You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man.
 Oh, take a car wash, hippie.
 Yeah, look at my husband, y'all. WHOO! That's your color!
 Yellow, baby. [chuckles]
 Mm! You smoking hot!
 [noticing McQueen and come towards them] There he is!
 Oh My Gosh! Did you know Doc is a famous race-car?!
 [All of the residents stay silent for a few seconds, then all of them except Sheriff laugh.]
 Doc? Our Doc?
 Not Doc Hudson.
 No no no no no, it's true! He's a real racing legend. He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
 Fabulous? I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour. I mean, have you ever seen him race?
 No, but I wish I could have of... They say he was amazing, he wins three Piston Cups!
 [spits out on his drink]POOOHHH!!!He did what in his cup?!
 I think the heat's starting to get to the boy!
 Well, I'll say! Look how red he is! [McQueen frowns]
 Yeah, I think he needs a new coat of poly, man.
 Are you sick, buddy?
 You are looking a little peaked.
 Yeah, he needs a new coat of poly for sure!
 Hey-Hey! What are you doing?!
 It's okay, Sheriff. You can trust me, right?
 I trust you, all right. It's him I'm worried about.
 Mm... I trust him. [to McQueen] Come on, let's take a drive.
 A drive?
 Yeah, a drive. Don't you big city race cars ever just take a drive?
 Uh, No. No, we don't.
 Hey, Stickers! Do you comin' or what?
 [Sally and the whole of then fly and chuff the other way out of town toward the courthouse. McQueen then turns around and follows them.] Mm-hm! [to Sheriff] And you thought he was gonna run. [Sheriff turns off his emergency lighting.]
 Hey, can you believe it, man? He actually thought Doc was a famous race-car! [Laughing] That's so too much! [We then see Doc inside his garage looking outside the window, now feeling sad.]
 [The screen shows McQueen and the whole of catching up with Sally after they go past Radiator Cap Mountain, to Sally] Okay, you got me out here. Where are we going?
 I don't know. [Then McQueen revs his engine and moves a bit ahead of Sally, then Sally revs hers and moves a bit ahead. McQueen does the same thing, then Sally races off.]
WHOA!Yes!
 Wow! What is this place?
 Wheel Well. Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
 [Our heroes then see a few gas pumps, and then look at some old cans and parts with flies flying and crawling.] This place? [The screen shows a closeup of the flies buzzing around and crawling. The car-ified bugs beep their horns. The camera then zooms out.]
 [sighs] Yeah, imagine...Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here.
 [to Sally] You know, I don't get you. How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
 Well, it's really pretty simple. I was... [drives into the motel, while our heroes follow her in.] ...an attorney in LA living life in the fast lane, and.
 Ah, you were, were you? Were you rich?
 What?
 Just... clues to the puzzle.
 Yeah, okay. Well, that was my life. And you know what? It never felt......happy.
 Yeah. I mean...really?
 [Then, Sally Carrera sings her version of the song "What More Is Out There" to McQueen and explaining her contemplating her place at LA, living life in the fast lane and also lamenting that she feels trapped at California with all the other rich cars and cannot find somewhere she truly belongs. While all our heroes listen to Sally, McQueen sings to himself in his mind about his racing life in the past and now in the present but now realizes somehow he's lacking and missing something very important in his life, but he couldn't figure out what it is.] Yeah. So I left California. Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here. Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in. Well, they all did. And I never left. [Sally then drives out of the motel as the screen shows from behind one of the windows with a few flies crawling on it, along with a dead one being upside down. Our heroes then follow Sally outside.]
 Yeah. You know, I understand. You need a little R & R. Recharge and old batteries. But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?
 [Inhales deeply] I fell in love.
 Oh.
 Yep.
 Corvette?
 No. [drives to the cliff with small logs as barriers, as McQueen and the whole team follow her] I fell in love with this. [The screen then changes to show the wonderful view of Ornament Valley and Radiator Springs.]
 Whoa. [seeing the mountain where the road led up to] Look at that. [sees some traffic driving on the Interstate 40 in the distance] Look, they're driving right by. They don't even know what they're missing! ["Our Town" starts to play.]
 Well, it didn't used to be that way.
 Oh, yeah?
 Yeah. 40 years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist.
 Really? [The screen shows the Interstate again as it does an illusion of the Interstate fading and the hills joined up.]
 Yeah. Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way.
 How do you mean? [The screen then goes to a flashback showing an aerial view of some traffic driving along Route 66 as Sally starts talking.]
 Well, the road didn't cut through land like that Interstate. It moved with the land, you know? It rose, it fell, it curved. [The screen then shows at ground level as it moves from side to side beside the road with traffic going by.]
 Mornin'! Nice day, huh?
 [narrating] Cars didn't drive on it to make a great time. They drove on it to have a great time.
 Well, what happened?
 The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.
 How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!Sally Carrera: Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that. But one of these days, we'll find a way to get it back on the map.Lightning McQueen: Yeah. [to Sally] Hey, listen, thanks for the drive. I had a great time. It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.Sally Carrera: You're welcome. [drives back to the Cozy Cone Motel][Suddenly, Mater rushes towards our heroes, looking worried.]Tow Mater: Hey, listen, listen! If anybody asks you, we was out smashing mailboxes, okay? [drives away]Lightning McQueen: [chuckling] Wha... What?
 Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that. But one of these days, we'll find a way to get it back on the map.
 Yeah. [to Sally] Hey, listen, thanks for the drive. I had a great time. It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.
 You're welcome. [drives back to the Cozy Cone Motel]
 Hey, listen, listen! If anybody asks you, we was out smashing mailboxes, okay? [drives away]
 [chuckling] Wha... What?
 Oh, man, the paint's still wet! [drives away]
 No No No No, Get out of the store! [notices another tractor munching on a radial tire]Hey?!DON'T EAT THE RADIAL!Here, take-a the snow tires. [nudges a set of snow tires. We then see McQueen and the whole of arriving at the scene as Sheriff, Fillmore, Sarge and Mater drive around the town, with Sheriff chasing one of the tractors, another tractor between Fillmore and Sarge as they drive around, while Mater is not chasing a tractor.]
MATER!
 I wasn't tractor-tipping!
 [angrily]THEN WHERE DID ALL THESE GOL-DURN TRACTORS COME FROM?!
 [McQueen laughs, exclaiming]WHOA, BOY! WHOA!
 [noticing a tractor driving away from the town] Hey! Hey, guys, There's one going this way! [pause] I got it! [McQueen and the whole team then follow the tractor, who is driving towards Willy's Butte.] Come here, little tractor, come here. [The tractor then stops.] Yeah, that's a good tractor. [But the tractor then moves away.] No, no, no, no, come here. [But the tractor just drives away.] What are you doing? You're not supposed to go wandering off all--[notices Doc Hudson on the track]--alone.
 What are you doing with those old racing tires? [The screen does a closeup of Doc's side to show us one of his racing tires. It then moves to on the road to show him still standing there. Doc sighs heavily] [McQueen whispering] Come on, Doc, drive.
 [sighs heavily] Yeah.
 [McQueen and the whole team come toward Doc.] Wow! [noticing our heroes] You're amazing! [But Doc just angrily drives away. McQueen coughs from the dust] What are you doing? Doc, wait!
 Giddy-up right in there! Come on, Rusty.WHEE-HE!
 [McQueen eventually catches up with Doc as he drives into his garage.] Doc, hold it! Seriously, your driving's incredible!
 [bitterly] Wonderful. Now, go away.
 [as he and the whole team drive into the garage] Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!
 [bitterly] I'm asking you to leave.
 Come on. I'm a race car, you're a much older race car, but under the hood you and I are the same.
 [angrily] We are not the same! Understand? Now, get out. [drives out of his garage]
 How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?
 [pauses, then coldly, yet angrily] You think I quit? [Doc then presses a button on the garage floor to turn on a light beside our hero, who then looks to see a newspaper's front page on the wall saying "Crash! Hudson Hornet out for season".]
 [crushed] Right. Your big wreck in 54.
 They quit on me. When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome. You know what they said? "You're history." Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line. [sadly] There was a lot left in me. I never got a chance to show 'em. [then bitterly] I keep that to remind me never to go back, I just never expected that that world would find me here.
 [annoyed] Hey, look, Doc, I'm not 'em.
 Oh, yeah?
 [annoyed] No, I'm not.
 [bitterly] When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod? You name me one time. And I will take it all back. [McQueen then feels ashamed.] Uh-huh? I didn't think so. [to McQueen, who then feels ashamed again] These are good folk around here, who care about one another. I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on.
 [annoyed] Oh, like you? You've been here how long and your friends don't even know who you are? [Doc then looks hurt at McQueen's fact.] Who's caring about only himself?
 [angrily] Just finish that road and get outta here! [drives away]
 [angrily]Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!
 Respect the classics, man.
 He's done. He must've finished it while we was all sleeping.
 Good riddance. [Doc then drives away as the other residents arrive at the same scene. Ramone has a red paint job.]
 He's gone?
 Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his. [Sally drives away.]
 [sniffs]
 Oh, dude, are you crying?
NO! I'M HAPPY! I DON'T HAVE TO WATCH HIM EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY ANYMORE! I'M GLAD HE'S GONE!
 [blubbers, then sobs and drives away, again knocking down that same pile of tires at that corner of the impound. Just then, McQueen and the whole of show up after just coming back through the portal to...]
 What's wrong with Red?
 [not realizing who he's talking to] Oh, he's just sad because you left town, and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup that you've always dreamed about your whole life and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talking about. [As he talks, the other residents then notice our heroes, looking glad. After finishing his quote, Mater stares at McQueen and the team as they are grinning. Mater gasps as he realizes who he was talking to] Wait a minute! [other laugh, smacks McQueen with his tire] I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
 [chuckles]
 What are you doing here, son? You're gonna miss your race. [turns on his emergency lighting] Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up the time.
 Thank you, Sheriff. But you know I can't go just yet.
 Well, why not?
 I'm not sure these tires... [Luigi gasps excitedly] ...can get me all the way to California. [Guido: Pit stop?!] Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?
 [laughing] I can't-a believe it!
 Four new tires! Grazien, Mr. Lightning. [gives a hug] Grazien!
 [Sally then arrives, feeling glad as she sees McQueen.] Would you look at that!
 Our first real customers in years! I am filled with tears of ecstasy, [While Luigi is talking, McQueen winks to and Sally, who is then shown smiling. Doc then appears, starting to feel glum when he sees McQueen.] for this is the most glorious day of my life!
 [as Luigi presses a button to make the car lift he is on go up] Alright, Luigi, give me the best set of black walls you've got.
 [releases the button, making the lift go back down] NO, No, No, No! You don't-a know what you want. Luigi know what you want. [drives to a couple of shelves, with one holding blackwall tires, and another being covered by a curtain] Black wall tires. They blend into the pavement. But-a this: [presses a button to pull the curtain, showing whitewall tires] "White-Wall Tires"! They say, "Look at me! Here I am! Love me."
 Alright, you're the expert.
 [chuckles and Doc snarls angrily and drives away]
 Oh, and don't forget the spare.
 Perfetto. Guido!
 Peet stop!
 [chuckling] What did Luigi tell you, Huh?
 Wow, you were right! Better than a Ferrari, huh?
 [frowns] Eh, no.
 [McQueen then frowns, and then the screen shows him and the whole team with Fillmore at the Taste-Inn, drinking some organic fuel.] Wow! This organic fuel is great! Why haven't I heard about it before?
It's a conspiracy, man!! The oil companies got a grip on the government!!They're feeding us a bunch of lies, man!
 Okay, I'll take a case.
Aw, yeah. Ka-chow.
 Here she comes!
 Okay, places, everybody. Hurry! Act natural.
 [Red whistles as Sally arrives] Hi, Sally!
 All right, what's going on?
 Ladies and gentle cars, please welcome the new:Lightning McQueen!
 [posing] POW! What do you think? Radiator Springs looks pretty good on me.
 [giggles] I'll say. [purrs as McQueen continues revving his engine] Ka-chow. You're gonna fit right in in California. Oh, my goodness, it looks like you've helped everybody in town.
 Yeah, everybody except one.
 Hey, is it getting dark out?
 Wh...What!? Wha--What'd he say?
 Let me say that again. Is it getting dark out?!
 Now, what was I supposed to do after that?
 [Gasping] They fixed their neon.
 Low and slow?
 Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckles as they take a cruise along the main road to the Courthouse. Flo laughs and shrieks. McQueen to Sally]
 Just like in its heyday, right?
 [exhales] It's even better than I pictured it. Thank you.
 Shall we cruise?
 [appearing out of nowhere] Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to! [pulls McQueen away]
 No no no!
 Lizzie!
 [to McQueen as they drive along] I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.
 [to Mater] Hey, "Miss Sally." May I have this cruise?
 Of course, Mater.
 [stopping them] A-A-Ah!
 ...and again and I said, "no," and he asked me again, and I said, "no..." [Sally giggles as she notices McQueen stepping sideways while with Lizzie] ...but, oh, he was a persistent little burger for a two-cylinder... [continues driving, while McQueen stops and turns around] ...finally I said, "alright, one little drive..." [McQueen looks to see the other townsfolk still cruising. Suddenly, Mater grabs him with his tow hook.]
OH!
 [laughs, "Dah ha ha ha ha ha!" tows him to Sally, and lets go]
 Hey!
 Thanks, Mater.
 Good evening, you two! [McQueen and Sally then look at each other. Lizzie standing next to Stanley's statue]
 Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this. [McQueen and Sally then touch each other's front. Flo noticing something]
 Is that what I think it is?
 Oh, I don't know, Flo. I haven't had a chance to find out. [both her and McQueen close their eyes] But I am going to find out. Hello.
 Not that! That!
 [Everyone then looks into the distance to see lots of headlights approaching. Sally gasping] Customers?
 Customers, everybody! And a lot of them! You know what to do, just like we rehearsed!
 [Suddenly, a blue light shines on McQueen. A townsfolk gasp] It's theGhost-Light!
 [shown to be shining the light] We have found McQueen! We have found McQueen!
 [It is then shown that the people who have arrived are actually the press, coming towards McQueen and surrounding him, flashing their cameras.] McQueen, over here, kid!
 Oh, wait......Excuse me.
 Is it true you've been in rehab?! Did you have a nervous breakdown, McQueen?!
 I'm sorry, what?
 McQueen's wearing whitewalls! Are the tires you wearing are turning balding?!
 Stickers, McQueen!
 [to Mater] Was Lightning McQueen your prisoner?!
 Shoot, no, we're best buds! I ain't bragging or nothing, but I was in charge of hunting him down if he tried to escape.
 Sally, Sally!
 McQueen, will you still race for the Piston Cup?!
 Stickers?!
 Sally!
 Come on, give us some bolt! [Suddenly, a horn honks, and the press clear the way for Mack.]
 YOU'RE HERE! Thank the manufacturer, you're alive!
 Mack?!
 [Mack turning around] You're here! I can't believe it! [Sally then watches as she notices the picture on the side of Mack's trailer. Mack chuckles to McQueen] You are a sight for sore headlights! I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you...
 Mack, I can't believe you're here!
Is that the world's fastest racing machine?
 Is that "Harv"?
 Yeah, he's in the back. [splits from his trailer, and McQueen turns around to the trailer door]
 Show us the bolt, McQueen!
 [drives towards the press, and angrily]GET BACK, YOU OIL-THIRSTY PARASITES!!!
 Hey, where's the old McQueen?!
 Actually, this is my good side here. [drives to a spot between McQueen and the press]
 Show us the bolt!
 Harv! Harv!
 Give us the bolt!
 [The trailer door then opens, showing no one in the trailer.] Harv?
 Come on!
 [on the phone, as it pops out]Kid, I'm over here!
 How you doing, buddy?
My star client disappears off the face of the earth! How do you think I'm doing?!
 Harv, I can explain...
I'm doing great! You're everywhere, baby, radio, TV, the papers! You can't buy this kind of publicity! What do you need me for?! That's just a figure of speech by the way you signed a contract. Where are you?! I can't even find you on my GPS.
 I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs. You know Route 66? It's still here!
Yeah, that's great, kid. Playtime is over, pal. While the world's been trying to find you, Dinoco has had no one to woo. Who are they gonna woo?
 [whispering and bitterly] Chick...
Bingo, in fact, check out what's on the plasma right now.
 [on TV]Show us the thunder!
 [on TV]You want thunder?You want thunder?![reflects sunlight on the "C" insignia]Ka-chicka, ka-chicka! Ka-chicka![laughing]
 Hey, that's my bit!
You've gotta get to Cali, pronto! Just get out of Radiation Stinks now, or Dinoco is history, you hear me?
 [noticing Sally beside the trailer] Just give me a second here, Harv. [drives to Sally]
No, no, wait, where are you going?! Get in the trailer, baby! Kid, you wa... You want a bigger trailer?!
 Sally, I want you to, look, I wish--[sighs]
 [sadly] Thank you. Thanks for everything.
 [sighs and laughs] It just a road.
 [sadly] No. It was much more than that. [The screen shows McQueen with tears in his eyes. Mack comes to McQueen]
 Hey, kid! We gotta go! Harv's going CRAZY! He's gonna have me fired if I don't get you in the truck right now!
 [sadly] Mack, just hold it for...
 [sadly] You should go.
 [sadly] I know, but...
 [sadly] Good luck in California. I hope you find what you're looking for. [drives away]
 McQueen, come on!
 [tries to follow Sally] Sally! [gets surrounded by the press]
 [angrily] Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt! Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt! Where's the old McQueen?! [The press make indistinct talk as McQueen is forced into the trailer, with Mack getting hooked up.]
Come on, kid, get in the trailer. That's it. That's right, kid, let's go! You're a big shining star. You're a superstar. You don't belong there, anyway.
 [As Harv is talking, McQueen takes one last look at the town and the whole of before the trailer door starts to close.] Whoa Wait Whoa Whoa Wait Wait! [The door closes, and Mack starts his engine as he gets going as other photographers are with Luigi, Guido and Red]
 Hey, guys! McQueen's leaving in the truck! [The press then leave, following Mack and talking indistinctly. Kori then notices Doc near Ramone's House of Body Art, and comes to him.]
 Hey, are you Doc Hudson?
 Yeah.
 Thanks for the call. [drives away]
 [The screen then zooms out to show Sally and the whole.] You called them?
 It's best for everyone, Sally.
 Best for everyone, or best for you? [drives away, Doc is shown frowning, and Sally comes onto the main road to watch Mack and the press drive away with McQueen. The other townsfolk and the whole of are seen behind her, watching as well. Doc then joins them.]
 [sadly] I didn't get to say goodbye to him.
 [The screen then shows a hill and goes over it to show the Los Angeles International Speedway. Bob and Darrell are heard talking as Al Oft flies over, along with the spectators coming into the circuit.] Hello, race fans, and welcome to what has become, quite simply, the biggest event in the history of racing. A three way battle for the Piston Cup!
 Bob, there's a crowd of nearly 200,000 cars here at the Los Angeles International Speedway. Tickets to this race are hotter than a black leather seat on a hot summer day!
 The King, Chick Hicks and Lightning McQueen in a 200-lap, winner-takes-all, tiebreaker race. [Then the screen fades to a different shit and moves to Darrell and Bob, who are in front of a couple of spectators, along with Todd the Pizza Planet truck and Elvis.]
 And Bob, you know I got a lotta miles on me, but let me tell you somethin' buddy. I never thought I'd see anything like this. Whoo! Man, this is exciting! [The screen then shows several closed signs on different buildings as Bob is talking, such as a person turning a sign from "Open" to "Closed", the sign for the East Honkers Shopping Mall saying "Closed for race", and Emery ville's sign showing a label saying "Closed for the race", and at the end of Bob's line, the screen shows some trucks and drivers watching the race on TV.]
 In fact, the country has almost shut down, to watch what many experts are callingthe race of the century.[The King's pit crew have finished putting a new set of tires on him, when Junior appears.]
 Hey, King! Good luck in your last race. You've sure been an inspiration to me.
 Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.
 Hey, be careful out there, okay?
 Yeah, man. [Then the screen shows Chick with the press again, with Mia and Tia behind him.]
 Oh! He's so hot!
 I know, right?
 [while the photographers are talking] Oh, yeah. You wanna know the forecast? I'll give you the forecast. A 100 percent chance ofTHUNDER![the press take pictures as he poses] Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Say it with me! [the press join in] Ka-chicka-chicka-chicka!
 [to Fred] Hey, you! No admittance without a garage pass.
 Oh, it's okay. Lightning McQueen knows me!
 [coming up with Patty] Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day for a race, isn't it?
 Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
 [Fred chuckles] And good morning to you uh [looks at Fred's license plate] Fred.
 Mario Andretti he knows my name! [to Marco] You gotta let me in now!
 Sorry, pal.
 Okay, here we go. Focus. Speed.
 I am speed.
 Victory. 1 winner, 2 losers.
 Speed, speed, speed, speed...
 Hey, Lightning, you ready?
 [gasps] Y-yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm uh... I'm ready. [McQueen then opens the door and comes out, noticing the press chattering indistinctly and taking pictures of him. The screen then shows an aerial view of the circuit, before coming back to the ground to show McQueen driving to Mack, who is wearing a headset.] Mack, thanks for being my pit crew today.
 Ahh. Don't worry about it, kid. It's the least I could do. After all, "Gas Can" is my middle name.
 It is?
 Ahh, not really.
 Uh-oh!
 Nelson! Zoom in. Ready, 16? Take 16. [One of the TV cameras then changes to show McQueen on the track with Chick and the King, as they warm up while behind Charlie Checker. While Bob and Darrell are talking, the cameramen aim their cameras at McQueen.]
 And there he is, Lightning McQueen! Missing all week, and then he turns up in the middle of nowhere! In a little town called Radiator Springs.
 Wearing whitewall tires, of all things. [McQueen grunts and as Chick's "C" sticker shines sunlight over his eyes]
 Ka-chicka, Ka-chicka, Ka-chicka! [laughs] Hey, where you been, McQueen? I've been kinda lonely. Nobody to hang out with. I mean, except the Dinoco folks. Oh, and the twins. Of course. You know the twins, the ones that used to be your fans, but now they're my fans. Anyway, listen to what the twins think...
 [Gasps]AAH!Shoot! [gets on his way]
 Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys! Let's go racing!
 Come on, you can do it!
 Come on, keep making us proud, boy!
 Fifty laps down, and The King is still holding a slim lead.
 [as McQueen gets beside Chick] Hey, McQueen's got a run on him! He's looking to the inside! [But then, Chick goes right in front of McQueen, causing him to brake.] Oh, Chick slammed the door on him!
 Chick's not making it easy on him today.
 Oh, man, he lost so much momentum, and now he's gonna have to chase him back down!
AH!!!
OH!!!McQueen spins out in the infield!
 [chuckles] Just me and the old man, fellas. McQueen just doesn't have it today.
 [through the radio] Hey, kid, you all alright?
 [sadly] I don't know, Mack. I...I don't think I'm-
 [through the radio] I didn't come all this way to see you quit.
 Doc?
 [everyone cheers]
 Guys, you're here! I can't believe this!
 I knew you needed a crew chief, but I didn't know it was this bad.
 I thought you said you'd never come back.
 Well, I really didn't have a choice. Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
Goodbye!!!Okay, I'm good.
 [chuckles]
 [McQueen then comes to the pits, as Mater holds a sign, which says "Radiator Springs Racing Team" along with the Radiator Springs' logo on it. Fillmore and Sarge refuel McQueen, to McQueen] Alright, if you can drive as good as you fix a road, then you can win this race with your eyes shut. Now, get back out there! [McQueen then drives back out through the pit lane.] Hot snot, we are back in business! Guido! Luigi! You're goin' up against professional pit crews boys, you're gonna have to be fast.
 They will not know what bit them!
 [to McQueen] Kid, [through the radio] you can beat these guys. Find a groove that works for you and get that lap back!
 Is that? Oh, wow. That's him!
 Is that--? That's the Hudson Hornet! Bob, Darrell, the Hudson Hornet's back!
 Darrell, it appears McQueen has got himself a pit crew. And look who he has for a crew chief! [All of the cameramen turn their cameras to show Doc, and the crowd then notices him.]
 Whoa! Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
 Whoa!
 Well, dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It surely is!
 [A whistle is heard, and the crowd then cheers. The screen then shows a TV at Flo's V8 Cafe showing Doc, as Sally, Red and Lizzie are watching the race on TV back in Radiator Springs.]
 Wow, this is history in the making. Nobody has seen the racing legend in over fifty years!
 [noticing Doc on the TV, not realizing it is him] Hey, Doc! Come look at this fellow on the radio! He looks just like you!
 McQueen passes them on the inside!
 But he's still nearly a lap down!
 Can he catch up to them with only sixty laps to go?
 You're going great, kid. Just keep your head on.
 Vai, vai, vai! [pushes a cart of tires away]
 Hey, shrimpie, where did McQueen find you, huh? Those round things are called tires, and they go UNDER THE CAR!
 [laughing]
 [angrily] Con chi credi di parlare?! Ma, con chi stai parlando?!
 No, no, no! You will have your chance, Guido. You will have your chance.
 Oh, kid's just trying to be a hero, huh? Well, what do you think of this?! [hits McQueen, causing him to spin] Yeah, that's it kid. [But McQueen manages to keep up with going backwards and past Chick.] WHAT?!
 Whoa!Git-R-Done![McQueen winks, and turns back around. Mater laughs] I taught him that. [poses to Chick's pit crew] KA CHOW!
 [getting their eyes hit by the sunlight reflecting off Mater's wing mirror]AH!!!
 What a move by McQueen, he's caught up to the leaders!
 Oh, yeah. This is what it's all about. A three-way battle for the lead, with ten to go!
 [chortles] Look at that boy go out there!
 [Chick then tries to get past McQueen, but gets blocked on several attempts. Chick gasps and grunts, before coming up beside McQueen]... [bitterly] No you don't! [presses against McQueen, causing a puncture in one of his rear tires]
 Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!
 Can you get back to the pits?
 Yeah, yeah. I think so.
 [noticing Dexter waving a yellow flag] Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in. Don't tear yourself up, kid. [Charlie Checker then comes out in front of the King and Chick.]
 We've gotta get him back out there fast or we're gonna be a lap down and we'll never win this race!
 Guido, it's time.
 Hey, tiny, you're gonna clean his windshield?! [everyone laughing]
 I don't believe it!
 That was the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!
 It was a great stop, but he's still gotta beat that pace car out!
 It's gonna be close!
 Yeah!
 [All of the crowd holler.] Yeah, baby!
 Yeah! [laughing]
 Yay! He's back in the race!
 [blows his wheel gun] Pit stop.
 Guido, you did it!
 Way to go, Guido!
 Yeah!
 This is it. We're heading into the final lap and McQueen is right behind the leaders. What a comeback!
 A hundred and ninety-nine laps, and, baby, it all comes down to this!
 This is it, kiddo. [through the radio to McQueen] You've got four turns left, one at a time. Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.GO!
 We'll see about that! [tries to get in front of McQueen, who then brakes, causing Chick to press against the wall, and making McQueen able to go past]
 McQueen's going inside! [But then, Chick rams McQueen off the track, and then hits the King, causing them both to serpentine.] Chick and The King are loose!
 I think McQueen is out of the race! [McQueen suddenly gets a thought, and turns his front tires right, allowing him to expertly drift through the grass. Recognizing the maneuver, Doc and the team are impressed and surprised as McQueen gets back on the track and slides past the King and Chick.] McQueen saved it!
 He's back on the track!
 Float like a Cadillac...
 Sting like a Beemer!
 Ka-chow, ka-chow, ka...
 Yaaaaaay! [laughing]
 Lightning McQueen is gonna win the Piston Cup!
 Come on, you got it, you got it, Stickers!
 [grunts as the King keeps blocking him, angrily] Argh! I am not coming in behind you again, old man.
 Oh no!
 Yeah!! Whoo-hoo!! [goes onto the infield and spins around] I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
 What's he up to, Doc?
 [weakly] What are you doing, kid?
 I think The King should finish his last race. [begins to push the King along the track]
 [weakly] You just gave up the Piston Cup, you know that?
 Ah, this grumpy old racecar I know once told me something. It's just an empty cup.
 Darrell, is pushing on the last lap legal?
 Hey, man. He's not really pushing him. He's just giving him a little bump draft.
 [still cheering] Whoo HoHoHoHo!!! [stops spinning upon noticing something] Hey! What?! What's going on?!
 That's what I call racing right there.
 [laughing]
 Bravo il mio amico!
 Way to go, buddy!
 There's a lotta love out there, you know, man?
 Don't embarrass me, Filmore.
 That's my hot rod.
 Come on, baby, bring it out! Bring out the Piston Cup. Ka-chicka, ka-chicka! [The trophy appears next to him.] Yeah-ha-ha! Now, that's what I'm talking about! Hey! How come the only one celebrating is me, huh?! Where are the girls?! Bring on the confetti! [gets shot at by the confetti]Ow!! Ow!!Easy with the confetti. What's going on? Come on, snap some pictures. I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco! Ka-chicka! Say it with me. (the press started booing angrily at Chick) Ka-chicka, ka-chicka, ka-chicka!
 Boo!
 Boo!
 (Chick then become irritated at the press) [angrily] What's wrong with everybody?! [gets hit by a tire] Ow! Where's the happiness!? [as the press, Mia and Tia all throw tires, shoes, "C" merchandise, oil cans and cartons at him] Hey! This is the start of the Chick era! [leaves with his trophy. Meanwhile, McQueen pushes the King back to the Dinoco stage. Lynda then kisses McQueen on the cheek.]
 Thanks, Lightning.
 You're welcome. [leaves]
 Way to go, King! You're still the car!
 You're The King! Yeah!
 [The crowd then cheers, before McQueen comes back to the Rust-eze team and who are laughing and cheering.]
 You made us proud, kid!
 Congrats on the loss, me bucko!
 You got a lotta stuff, kid.
 Thanks, Doc.
 Hey, Lightning. How about coming over here and talk to me a minute? [McQueen drives over to him] Son, that was some real racin' out there. How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco?
 [feeling surprised, looks towards the Dinoco team, which Rotor Turbosky winks] But I didn't win.
 Lightning, there's a whole lot more to racing than just winning.
 He was so rusty, when he drove down the street, buzzards used to circle the car!
 [laughs]
 [looking towards them] Thank, you, Mr. Tex, but...but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break. I'm gonna stick with them.
 Well, I sure can respect that. Still, you know, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.
 I sure appreciate that, thank you... Actually, there is one thing...
 [riding in Rotor Turbosky, Dinoco is helicopter, over Radiator Springs]WHOO-HOO![laughs] Hey, look at me! I'm flying, by golly! Whoo-hoo! [as most of the Radiator Springs residents watch from the ground] I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park! [Then the screen shows Luigi and Guido looking at their tire shelves in their store.]
 [to Guido] I think it's about-a time we redecorate.
 [arriving with Antonio Veloce Eccellente and Costanzo Della Corsa]CHOW!Hi, Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires. How about setting me and my friends up with three or four sets each?
 [Gasps] Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store. A REAL FERRARI! Punch me, Guido, punch me in the face! This is the most glorious day of my life! [Faints]
 Whoa, [speaks Italian to Guido]Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda. Mi dicono che siete fantastici.
 Just passing through?
 Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile, I hear this place is back on the map.
 It is?
 Yeah, there's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar is setting up his big racing headquarters here.
 Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.
 You know, I really missed you, Sally.
 Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
 [chuckles as they move slowly toward each other, Mater suddenly appears onboard Rotor]
 McQueen and Sally parked beneath the tree, K-I-S-S... uhh... I-N-G!
 Great timing, Mater!
 [as Rotor flies away] Hepnon, hiphep, hilililly! Wheeeeeee!!
 [to Sally] He's my best friend. What're you gonna do?
 So, Stickers. Last one to Flo's buys?
 I don't know. Why don't we just take a drive?
 Hmm, nah. [quickly drives away]
 Yeah! [revs his engine]Ka-Chow!!! [follows Sally and as they race each other, while John Mayer's version of "Route 66" plays, with Mater yelling while riding in Rotor.]
YEEEEEEHHEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
 All right, everybody please keep together now. We is now entering the Doc Hudson wing of the museum. [shows them the part that mentions Doc having 27 wins in 1952]
 Whoa. Unbelievable. That many wins in a single season.
 He's the real deal, Junior. The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.
 [to Mater] Excuse me, son. Is Doc Hudson here today?
 Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc went out for a drive or something.
 Whoo-ooh!
 Yeah!
 Whoo-hoo!
 Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.
 Not today, old man. I know all your tricks.
 Ye-YEAH! [turns towards the cliff, McQueen stops and looks down the edge]
 Doc! Doc!
 [jumping back to the ground level McQueen is on] Whoo-ah! Not all my tricks, rookie!
 Attention! Kiss the pavement goodbye, gentlemen. When I'm finished with you, you'll have mud in places you didn't know you had!
 Yo, I've never been off-road!
 [drives towards him] Well, that's gonna change right now! About face! [Charlie Cargo, Murphy and Frank Pinkerton quickly turn around the other way, while T.J. steps slowly around.] Drop and give me 20 miles! [Charlie, Frank Pinkerton and Murphy then drive off the road onto the dirt, while T.J. is still stepping around slowly.] Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go!
 [driving on the dirt] Man, now I got dirt in my rims!
 [Then the screen shows Mater fishing items from a valley. His hook hits something metal.] Huh? [to McQueen] Look at this! It's my hood, it's my hood, I ain't seen this thing in 20 years! [puts his hood on, with his voice now sounding funny] Well, it fits perfectly. How do I look? [As Mater sneezes, his hood falls off and back into the valley.] Nah, dang.
YOU ARE A TOY CAAAAAAAAR!!!
 You are a sad, strange little wagon and you have my pity. Farewell! [drives away]
 Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, you loony!
 Hey, I hate to break up the road rally, guys, butthey're here! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
(chuckling)HohohoOh, man! Whoever does the voice of that piggy truck, I'm telling ya, he's one great actor!
 [Then it showsMonster Trucks, Inc.being shown.] We're banished, genius! Stuck out here in this wasteland without chains!
 But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble! She needs our help!
 You're still not listening! [Mike Car and Sulley Truck gasp as he sees the Yeti.]
 Welcome to the Himalayas! Snow cone?
 Oh, that Abominable Snowplow is quite the comic thespian!
 [Then it showsA Bug's Lifebeing shown.] Just get in there! Go, go go go! [to the Circus Bugs] Circus cars?! How can you be circus cars?!
 [appearing in front of the Circus Bugs.] These are the lousiest circus cars in the world, and they're gonna make me rich!
 Wait a minute here. They're just using the same actor over and over. What kind of a cut rate production is this?!
(moans)Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we please ask someone for directions?
 No! There's an on ramp close! I know it, I can feel it(laughs while almost driven to insanity.)Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha oh
