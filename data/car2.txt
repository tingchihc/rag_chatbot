Leland: This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile. Finn, my cover's been compromised. Everything's gone pear-shaped. You won't believe what I found out here. [turns his camera to a window, where the light from the oil rig's flames shines through] This is bigger than anything we've ever seen, and no one even knows it exists! [turns his camera back to the previous location to show himself] Finn, I need backup, but don't call the cavalry, it could blow the operation. And be careful. It's not safe out here.
Acer: [off-screen] Let's go!
Leland: Transmitting my grids now. Good luck!
[The camera is moved to show the silhouettes of Grem and Acer outside the room, as the grids are shown. The picture then splits into pixels, before showing the film's logo forming with the "2" being made inside the box where "Cars" is shown, before being taken out to show the complete logo that now says "Cars 2", which then fades before the screen shows the Pacific Ocean at night, with the coordinates of 40° 6.80' N, 172° 23.84' W being shown as the camera moves to show a boat named Crabby moving across the ocean while carrying Finn McMissile. Beeping sounds are heard as Crabby's radar is shown, which then shows the coordinates.]
Crabby: All right, buddy, we're here. Right where you paid me to bring you. Question is, why?
Finn: I'm looking for a car.
Crabby: A car? Ha! Hey, pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here.
Finn: Exactly where I want to be.
Crabby: Well, I got news for you, buddy. There's nobody out here but us.
[Suddenly, a ship's horn is heard as Tony Trihull, a battleship, arrives, while Finn hides in the shadows]
Tony: What are you doing out here?!
Crabby: What does it look like, genius? I'm crabbing!
Tony: Well, turn around and go back where you came from!
Crabby: Yeah, and who's gonna make me?
[Tony deploys his gun.]
Crabby: All right! All right! Don't get your prop in a twist! [turns around, as Tony heads back to the oil rigs] What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks like it's the end of the line. [hears no answer] Buddy?
[The screen shows that Finn is not on Crabby, which it then reveals that Finn is holding onto the back of Tony with his grappling hooks. Tony honks his horn as he sails to the oil rigs. Finn notices many of the flames from the oil rigs, and as Tony reaches one of them, Finn moves down when a bright light shines on Tony, which the oil rig begins to light up. Finn then shoots his left grappling hook over a barrier on the oil platform, and releases his other grappling hook from Tony, activating his steel magnet wheels and driving up one of the oil rigs' poles as Tony gets picked up by a mechanical grabber. When he notices the other oil rigs lighting up, Finn immediately circles around pole and gets onto one of the floors, and comes to a hiding place, where he sees many cars down below.]
Tannoy: Incoming. All workers report to the loading dock.
Finn: [through his radio] Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile. I'm at the rally point. Over. [hears static]
Grem: [as the other cars gather up] All right, fellas, you know the drill.
Finn: [through his radio] Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over. [hears static again, then he takes out his spy camera from inside his right headlight to zoom in on the thugs]
Acer: Come on, guys. These crates aren't gonna unload themselves. [opens a crate]
Zündapp: [German accent] [speaks indistinctly as he appears] Raus hier, get out of here. Too many cars here. Out of my way.
Finn: [after he scans the professor] Professor Zündapp?
Rod: [in Gremlin disguise] Here it is, Professor. You wanted to see this before we load it?
Zündapp: Ah, yes. Very carefully.
[Muggsy then opens the box, which has a camera in it. Finn immediately starts taking pictures of it.]
Zündapp: Sehr gut.
Rod: Oh! A TV camera. What does it actually do?
Zündapp: This camera is extremely dangerous.
Finn: What are you up to now, Professor? [uses his mounted quad harpoon gun from his undercarriage to sink into the structure of each of the platform's sides, and whizzes across, before moving himself down to get a closer look, taking more pictures of the camera]
Zündapp: This is valuable equipment. Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage.
Rod: You got it.
Grem: Hey, Professor Z! This is one of those British spies we told you about.
[While Grem is talking, Muggsy closes the box, and he and Rod leave. Finn gets out one of his machine guns as he watches Zündapp coming to Grem and Acer, who are beside a crate.]
Acer: Yeah! This one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong.
Zündapp: Agent Leland Turbo.
[Acer then opens the lock on the crate, then a crane picks up the crate's top and sides, showing Leland Turbo crushed into a cube.]
Finn: [gasps]
[Suddenly, flames are emitted from the oil platform, casting Finn's shadow, which Zündapp then looks up to see him.]
Zündapp: It's Finn McMissile! [as Finn begins to shoot at them] He's seen the camera! Kill him!
Tannoy: All hands on deck! All hands on deck!
[Finn begins to rush back to the floor, but notices the thugs already at all four lines, turning on their blowtorches. Finn then releases three of his lines to swing onto a crane and get onto another floor, turning 180 degrees towards a ramp as a green Gremlin chases him. Finn then launches oil out of his rear turn signals.]
Green Gremlin: [slipping on the oil] Whoa! [Finn then shoots one of his grappling hooks around a pole, and makes a turn as the Gremlin heads towards the edge.] Aah! [falls off] Waargh! [lands into the ocean, with his body coming apart]
[The chase continues as more thugs chase Finn up a spiral ramp. Noticing several oil barrels on a level above, Finn uses one of his guns to shoot a railing, causing the oil barrels to fall down the ramp. Finn then launches a magnetic bomb from one of his front wheel hubs onto one of the barrels, which explodes when it comes to the bottom of the ramp, causing the other barrels to explode in a chain reaction and kill all the thugs going up the ramp, and destroys the rest of the ramp as Finn gets to the top just in time. However, more thugs chase him onto a helipad, where they all surround him. As several of the lemons turn on their blowtorches, Finn revs his engine for a couple of seconds, before he reverses off the edge.]
Jerome Ramped: Wha-?
[Finn then lands into the sea, going underneath the surface as Grem and Acer watch from the helipad. Finn then comes to the surface, going into hydrofoil mode, and speeds away.]
Grem: Get to the boats!
[Grem and Acer then rush to Tony and another combat ship, who are both released by the grabbers, and chase after Finn. Tony shoots missiles at Finn, who is able to dodge them by doing serpentine. Acer then uses an independent shooter on the other combat ship to shoot at Finn, who still does serpentine to dodge them.]
Acer: He's getting away!
Tony: Not for long! [shoots out a torpedo]
[Just as the torpedo is about to hit Finn, it explodes, causing the water to shoot up, before it shows flames on the surface, as the combat ships search around it to see if Finn is still alive. The camera moves into the water, showing that Finn is still alive, leaving trails of oil from his rear turn signals. He then transforms into a submarine, with an oxygen tank over his mouth, and escapes as he releases a set of tires from his trunk. The tires all come up to the surface inside the circle of flames.]
Grem: [chuckles, then talks to Zündapp over the radio] He's dead, Professor.
Zündapp: Wunderbar! With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now?
[The screen then shows Mater driving along Route 66, about a mile away from Radiator Springs.]
Mater: Mater -Tow Mater, that's who - is here to help ya. [sees Otis on the side of the road, with his engine choking] Hey, Otis!
Otis: Hey, Mater! I... Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry. I... I thought I could make it this time, but... [tries to get going, but his engine fails to start] Smooth like pudding, huh? [sighs] Who am I kidding? I'll always be a lemon.
Mater: Well, dad-gum, you're leakin’ oil again! Must be your gaskets. [hooks his tow hook on Otis, and starts to tow him] Hey, but look on the bright side. This is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house!
Otis: You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.
Mater: Hey, don't sweat it! Shoot, these things happen to everybody, Otis.
Otis: But you never leak oil!
Mater: Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't tell nobody either, but I think my rust is startin’ to show through.
Otis: [as they pass by the billboard, which shows a picture of McQueen] Hey! Is Lightning McQueen back yet?
Mater: Not yet.
Otis: He must be crazy excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup! Four! Wow!
Mater: Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him, but I sure wish he'd hurry up and get back, 'cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. Just me and... [gasps as he sees McQueen in the town, as Mack's horn is heard honking] McQueen! [rushes to McQueen, but forgets that he is towing Otis]
Otis: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mater: McQueen!
Otis: Mater! I'm in no hurry! You don't need to go so fast!
Mater: [moving his hook up and down, causing Otis to hit the ground repeatedly] Hey, everybody! McQueen's back! McQueen's back! McQueen's back! McQueen's back! McQueen's back!
Otis: Aaah! Ahh! Aaah! Oooh-hoo! Oooh-hah! Aah!
Luigi: Oh, Lightning! Welcome home!
Flo: Good to have you back, honey!
Fillmore: Congratulations, man.
Sarge: Welcome home, soldier.
Sheriff: The place wasn't the same without you, son.
Lizzie: What?! Did he go somewhere?
McQueen: It's good to be home, everybody. [hears Mater honking his horn] Mater!
Mater: McQueen!
Otis: Aah!
McQueen: Mater!
Mater: McQueen!
Otis: Oooh!
[Mater then stops at the crossroad in front of McQueen, and lets go of Otis, who is moved along into Ramone's House of Body Art as Sally and Flo dodge him.]
Otis: Whoooa! [stops as he comes onto wheel ramps]
Ramone: Hey, how far did you make it this time, Otis?
Otis: Halfway to the county line.
Ramone: Ooh, not bad, man!
Otis: I know! I can't believe it either!
Mater: McQueen! Welcome back!
McQueen: [as they do a special "tireshake"] Mater, it's so good to see you.
Mater: You too, buddy! Oh, man, you ain't gon’ believe the things I got planned for us!
Mack: Oh, these best friend greetings. They get longer every year!
Mater: You ready to have some serious fun?
McQueen: Well, actually, I've got something to show you first.
[The screen then shows McQueen's trophy, which has the name of "Hudson Hornet Piston Cup", and a model of Doc Hudson on top, as Mater and McQueen are in the Doc Hudson Racing Museum.]
Mater: Wow! I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson!
McQueen: I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know?
Mater: [to McQueen] Well, Doc would've been real proud of ya. That's for sure.
McQueen: [grins] [to Mater, as they both come out of the museum] All right, pal. I've been waiting all summer for this. What you got planned?
Mater: Ho-ho-ho! You sure you can handle it?
McQueen: C'mon, do you know who you're talking to? This is Lightning McQueen! I can handle anything.
[McQueen and Mater ride on a railroad track. Both have their tires off.]
McQueen: Er...Mater?
Mater: Just remember, your brakes ain't gon’ work on these! [pushes McQueen down the slope toward a tunnel]
McQueen: [as they head to the tunnel] Mater?
Mater: Ah, relax. These train tracks ain't been used in years!
[After they head into the tunnel, a train horn is heard.]
Mater: Aaaah! [as they go back out of the tunnel] Aaaah!
McQueen: Faster, faster! Come on. Here we go! Faster!
[The train actually turns out to be Galloping Geargrinder.]
Galloping Geargrinder: [laughs]
[Next, Mater takes McQueen to a field, where Colossus XXL, a giant dump truck, is sleeping.]
Mater: [chuckles] Heh, heh. Heh, heh.
McQueen: Ooh. Wow. Yeah, uh... I don't know. D-D-Do you think?
Mater: This is gon’ be good!
[Mater honks his horn and McQueen revs his engine, as Colossus XXL tips over and hits the ground hard.]
Mater: [laughs] Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
McQueen: [laughs] Did you see that?
[They stop laughing when they hear oil from the exhaust.]
Mater: Uh-oh. This ain't gon’ be good.
[Colossus XXL backfires a burst of smoke from his exhaust, sending McQueen and Mater. The screen then shows them driving back to Radiator Springs. Mater had got a blue balloon which says "Kersploosh Mountain", while McQueen feels exhausted.]
Mater: Ha-ha! Boy, this was the best day ever! And my favorite souvenir, this new dent.
McQueen: Boy, Mater, today was ah...
Mater: Shoot, that was nothin’. [to McQueen] Wait till you see what I got planned for tonight!
McQueen: Mater, Mater, whoa! I was kinda thinking of just a quiet dinner.
Mater: Hey, that's exactly what I was thinkin'.
McQueen: No, I-I meant with Sally, Mater.
Mater: Even better! You, me, and Miss Sally goin' out for supper.
McQueen: Mater, uh, I meant it would be just me and Sally.
Mater: Oh.
McQueen: You know, just for tonight.
Mater: Oh...
McQueen: We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.
Mater: OK.
McQueen: Thanks for understanding.
Mater: Yeah, sure. You go on and have fun now.
McQueen: All right, then. See you soon, amigo. [leaves]
Mater: [sighs]
[The screen shows the Wheel Well Motel, which appears to be turned into a restaurant, as there are cars sitting at tables, including McQueen and Sally. Guido, Luigi, Fillmore, and Sarge are inside the Wheel Well]
Sally: [looking at the view] Ah, this is so nice.
McQueen: I can't tell you how good it is to be here alone, just the two of us, finally. You and me.
Mater: [dressed as a waiter] Ahem! Good evening.
Sally: Oh!
Mater: My name is Mater, and I'll be your waiter. [chuckles] Mater the waiter. That's funny right there.
McQueen: Wha...? Mater? [stammers] You work here?
Mater: Well, yeah, I work here. What'd you think? Do you think that I just snuck in here when nobody was lookin' and pretended to be your waiter just so I could hang out with you?
Sally: [chuckles]
McQueen: Oh, yeah. [chuckles] How ridiculous would that be?
Mater: Now, can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple of drinks?
McQueen: Yes. I'll have my usual.
Sally: [chuckles] Oh, you know what? I'm gonna have that, too.
Mater: [as his tow cable drops] Uh... Right. Your usual. [drives into the motel]
McQueen: [laughs]
[Inside, Guido is serving drinks for Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi. The TV is showing a show called "Tire Talky", which has Todd as a guest.]
Fillmore: [as Guido gives out the drinks] Thanks, man.
Luigi: Grazie, Guido!
Mater: [arrives] Guido, what's McQueen's usual?
Guido: [speaks in Italian] Come faccio a saperlo? (How do I know?)
Mater: Perfect! Give me two of ‘em.
Sarge: Quiet! My program's on.
Mel: [on TV] Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show... His story gripped the world. Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without GPS, ironically ran out of gas, and found himself trapped in the wild. Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later, running on a fuel he distilled himself from the natural elements! Since then, he's sold his oil fortune, converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, clean-burning fuel. Now he claims to have done it with his Allinol. And to show the world what his new super fuel can do he's created a racing competition like no other, inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever World Grand Prix. Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.
Axlerod: [on TV] Thank you, Mel. It is very, very good to be here. Now, listen to me. Big oil. It costs a fortune. Pollution is getting worse. I mean, come on, it's a fossil fuel. "Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs. And we all know what happened to them. Alternative energy is the future. Trust me, Mel. After seeing Allinol in action at the World Grand Prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again.
Mater: What happened to the dinosaurs, now?
Mel: [on TV] And on satellite, a World Grand Prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world, Francesco Bernoulli.
Francesco: [on TV] It is an honor, Signore Dorado, for you.
Mel: [on TV] Miles, why not invite Lightning McQueen?
Mater: Huh? Whatsit?
Axlerod: [on TV] Of course we invited him, but apparently after his very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest.
Francesco: [on TV] The Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco.
Mater: [feels angered] Huh!
Francesco: [on TV] I can go over 300 kilometers an hour. I-In miles, that is like, uh... [stutters] way faster than McQueen.
Mel: [on TV] Let's go to the phones. Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.
Caller: Am I on? Hello?
Mel: [on TV] You're on. Go ahead.
Caller: Hello?
Mel Dorado: [on TV] Go ahead, caller. [hears the line going dead] Let's go to Radiator Springs. You're on, caller.
Mater: [through the telephone] Yeah, that Italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world.
Sarge: [as he and the others look behind to see Mater on the phone] Uh-oh.
Francesco: [on TV] If he is, uh, how you say, uh, "the bestest race car," then why must he rest? Huh?
Mater: [through the telephone] 'Cause he knows what's important. Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life.
Francesco: [on TV] Oh! You heard it! Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow! Of course, this is not news to Francesco. When I want to go to sleep, I watch one of his races. After two laps, I am out cold.
Mater: [through the telephone] That ain't what I meant.
[While Mater and Francesco are talking, all of the customers, and even the rest of the residents, come in to see what is happening, all murmuring at Francesco's quote of being out cold. McQueen and Sally, who are still outside and enjoying themselves, then notice everyone coming into the motel.]
McQueen: Hey, what's goin’ on over there?
[McQueen and Sally then come in to see what is going on.]
Francesco: [on TV] He is afraid of Francesco.
McQueen: [notices Francesco on the TV] That's that Italian formula car. His name is...
Sally: [says his name more than three syllables] Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder there's a crowd.
McQueen: Hey, why do you know his name? And don't say it like that. It's three syllables, not ten.
Sally: What? He's nice to look at. You know, open-wheeled and all.
McQueen: What's wrong with fenders?
Sally: Nothing!
McQueen: I thought you liked my fenders.
Mater: [through the telephone] Let me tell you something else, Mr. San Francisco.
McQueen: Mater?
Mater: [through the telephone] McQueen could drive circles around you.
Francesco: [on TV] Driving in circles is all he can-a do, no?
Mater: [through the telephone] No. I mean, yes. I mean, he could beat you anywhere. Any time, any track.
[While Mater is talking, McQueen and Sally look toward Guido, who points to Mater using the telephone. McQueen and Sally then look to see what Mater is doing.]
Francesco: [on TV] Mel, can we move on? Francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation, like a dump truck.
Mater: [through the telephone] Ha-ha! That shows what you know. Dump trucks is dumb. [gets grabbed and pulled out by McQueen] Hey! Whoa!
McQueen: [through the telephone] Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.
Francesco: [on TV] The Lightning McQueen, huh?
McQueen: [through the telephone] Look, I don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that.
Francesco: [on TV] McQueen, that was your best friend? Oh! This is the difference between you and Francesco. Francesco knows how good he is. He does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it.
McQueen: [through the telephone] And those are strong words from a car that is so fragile.
Francesco: [on TV, shouting] FRAGILE! He calls-a Francesco fragile! Not-a so fast, McQueen!
McQueen: [through the telephone] "Not so fast." What is that? Your new motto?
Francesco: [on TV] Motto?! Questo è tormo volto quevedo se questo programma ridicolo..! [audio gets switched to Axlerod, which causes Francesco to get mad and leave his screen, before rubbing his rear tires on the ground]
Axlerod: [on TV] Well, this sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course. What do you say, Lightning McQueen? We've still got room for one more racer.
McQueen: [through the telephone] Well, I would love to. The only thing is, my crew is off for the season, so... [looks back to see Ramone painting a banner saying "Team McQueen", and Guido popping the corks out of some wine bottles with his wheel gun]
Guido: Pit stop.
McQueen: You know what? They just got back. Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow! Yeah!
[Everyone then cheers, along with Sheriff chuckling, while Francesco appears on his screen, looking unhappy. McQueen then reverses out of the phone booth to talk to Sally.]
McQueen: I know, I know. I just got back, but we won't be long and...
Sally: Oh! No, don't worry about me. I mean, I've got enough to do here. Mater's going to have a blast, though.
McQueen: [pauses for a moment]
Sally: You're bringing Mater, right? You never bring Mater to any of your races.
[McQueen looks toward Mater, about to take a slurp from a drink and gulps, but then makes muffled cries as he feels the strong taste. Finding nowhere else to put it, he slurps it back into the same glass.]
Mater: Ah.
Sally: Just let him sit in the pits. Give him a headset. Come on, it will be the thrill of a lifetime for him.
Mater: Your drink, sir.
McQueen: Mater.
Mater: I didn't taste it!
McQueen: How'd you like to come and see the world with me?
Mater: [gasps] You mean it?
McQueen: Yeah. You got me into this thing. You're coming along!
Mater: All right!
[The screen shows McQueen inside a paint booth, being repainted by Ramone for the World Grand Prix, including a modified spoiler and actual headlights, while the song "You Might Think" plays. After Ramone finishes, McQueen comes out of the booth, revs his engine, and makes a pose.]
McQueen: Ka-chow! [flashes his headlights]
[The screen then shows McQueen's crew, which consists of Mater, Luigi, Guido, Sarge, and Fillmore. Most of them move back for Mater to show up, with a sticker of McQueen's bolt and racing number on his sides.]
Mater: Ha-ha!
[The screen then shows an airline timetable on the wall of an airport, before showing a forklift waving its traffic batons at a plane, which the camera then shows Team McQueen on the boarding stairs, waving to Sally, Red, Ramone, Flo, and Sheriff. Red is seen crying inaudibly, and the camera then shows inside the airport as they watch the plane take off for Tokyo, Japan. At nighttime, during the journey, a flight attendant called Daniella Muffler offers snacks to McQueen and Mater, while the others are all asleep. The screen then skips to show McQueen and Mater watching a game show, where a car named Yukio is going down a ramp and hopping through giant road signs, with a column between each of them. Yokio then hits the final sign which is sealed, causing him to fall onto a platform, where the announcers, named Takeshi and Hiroaki, appear on the screen, laughing. In response to this, McQueen and Mater laugh as well. Then the screen shows the plane, named Everett, landing in Tokyo while the sun sets again, before showing aerial views of Tokyo with the lights of Tokyo Tower and the skyscrapers turning on as it gets dark. It then shows McQueen, Mater, Luigi, Guido, Fillmore, and Sarge driving, walking and fluttering in the streets, with other traffic around them, including Kabuto and Suki, seeing all the different neon signs. When they see a sign advertising a vacuum cleaner called "Lightning McClean", McQueen and Mater. The screen then shows a truck named Taia Decotura driving past with a screen on him showing Francesco performing tricks with a soccer ball. The screen next shows a car purchasing an item from a vending machine, before showing McQueen and Mater, then another car getting into a capsule hotel, before showing McQueen and Mater come into a shop full of McQueen merchandise. An RC McQueen toy then bumps into McQueen, who then looks to see Cartney Brakin, who is one of his fans.]
McQueen: Hey!
[Cartney then faints in excitement. The screen then shows both teams inside Kabuki-za watching Okuni and another kabuki dancer perform. Mater, who has paint of Japan's flag on his front along with an umbrella and drinks, is then seen backing up through the crowd to meet up with the team, as McQueen and the whole team look concerned.]
Mater: [getting through the crowd] Hey, excuse me! [comes up to McQueen, and speaks in Japanese] Domo arigato!
[The camera then shows the team inside Ryōgoku Kokugikan, where Pinion Tanaka and Kingpin Nobunaga are doing sumo. Pinion wins, which Kimura Kaizo, the referee, holds out a knockout sign.]
Mater: Yeah!
McQueen: [laughs]
[The screen then shows the team arriving at a museum which is similar to the National Art Center, as the press take pictures of them and the other World Grand Prix racers, before showing them entering a floor above the ground, as a couple of cameramen appear, along with Okuni, Shigeko, and Tamiko, before showing different views of inside the building, then showing Terry Gong banging a gong, as the song "Polyrhythm" starts to play. The team is then seen going down a spiral ramp to the ground.]
Luigi: [noticing some Ferrari cars] Guido, look! Ferraris and tires. Let's go! [heads off with Guido to meet the Ferrari cars]
McQueen: Ho-ho! Look at this! OK, now, Mater, remember, best behavior.
Mater: You got it, buddy. [notices a Zen rock garden] Hey, what's that? [heads off]
McQueen: No, Mater!
Lewis: Hey, McQueen! Over here!
McQueen: Lewis!
Lewis: Hey, man.
McQueen: Jeff!
Jeff: Hey, Lightning! Can you believe this party?
[Then the screen shows Mater coming to the Zen rock garden, which is shielded by glass, and has a truck called Zen Master making shapes in the sand.]
Mater: [taps on the glass to get Zen Master's attention] Hey! You done good. You got all the leaves!
Jeff: Check out that tow truck!
Lewis: Man, I wonder who that guy's with.
McQueen: Ah... Will you guys excuse me just for one little second? [drives towards Mater]
Mater: Ho-ho! Good job!
McQueen: Mater!
Mater: Huh?
McQueen: Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.
Mater: You're just realizin’ that? Oh-ho! That jet lag really done a number on you.
McQueen: Mater, look, things are different over here. Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different, too.
Mater: Different than what?
McQueen: [to Mater] Well, just help me out here, buddy. I...
Mater: You need help? Shoot! Why didn't you just say so? That's what a tow truck does.
McQueen: Yeah, I mean...
Mater: [notices Francesco talking to a couple of ladies] Hey, looky there! It's Mr. San Francisco. I'll introduce you. [drives towards Francesco, with the others following him]
McQueen: Mater, no!
Mater: Look at me! I'm helping you already. Hey, Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you to meet...
Francesco: Ah, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
McQueen: Erm, nice to meet you, Francesco.
Francesco: Nice to meet you, too. You are very good-looking. Not as good as I thought, but you're good.
Mater: Excuse me. Can I get a picture with you? [stands next to Francesco]
Francesco: Ah, anything for McQueen's friend.
Mater: [as a screen above them captures illustrations of their actions] Miss Sally is gon’ flip when she sees this.
McQueen: [sighs]
Mater: She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.
Francesco: Oooh!
Mater: She's a big fan of yours.
Francesco: Hey, she has-a good taste.
McQueen: Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".
Mater: You're right. She's a huge fan! [to Francesco] She goes on and on about your open wheels here.
McQueen: Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going on and on.
Francesco: Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco. Women respect a car that has-a nothing to hide.
McQueen: Yeah, er... [shakes his frame, does a fake laugh and smile]
Francesco: Let us have a toast.
McQueen: Let's.
Francesco: I dedicate my win tomorrow to Miss Sally.
McQueen: Oh. Sorry. I already dedicated my win tomorrow to her. So, if we both do it, it's really not so special. Besides, I don't have a drink.
Mater: I'll go get you one. Hey, do you mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks?
McQueen: They're free, Mater.
Mater: Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing here? [leaves]
McQueen: I should probably go keep an eye on him. See you at the race.
Francesco: Yes, you will see Francesco, but not like this. [turns around to show a label on his rear wing saying, "Ciao, McQueen"] You will see him like-a this as he drives away from you.
McQueen: Ha! That's cute! So, you had one of those made up for all the racers?
Francesco: [turns around] No.
McQueen: [chuckles] Okay. [drives away]
Francesco: Ciao, McQueen!
McQueen: [to himself] He is so getting beat tomorrow!
PA: Ladies and gentlecars, Sir Miles Axlerod!
Axlerod: It is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first ever World Grand Prix! From Brazil, number 8...
[The crowd cheers. While Axlerod is saying his second sentence, the camera shows Kabuto, Chisaki, Suki, Yokoza, Ichigo, and Harumi on a bridge, before it moves down to show Finn arriving on the ground floor. Using a hiding spot from a structure, he uses his spy camera to scan the press' TV cameras, to see if they match the one on the oil platform. None of them do, and Finn then notices Holley Shiftwell, who then comes to him.]
Holley: Oh, hello.
Finn: Hello.
Holley: A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
Finn: That's because it's air-cooled.
Holley: Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station. I have a message from London.
Finn: Not here. You must try the canapés on the mezzanine.
[Both Finn and Holley go onto an elevator to find a floor that is more private.]
Finn: So, the lab boys analyzed the photo I sent? What did they learn about the camera?
Holley: It appears to be a standard television camera. They said if you could get closer photos next time that would be great.
Finn: This was London's message?
Holley: Oh, no. No. No, sir. Erm... The oil platforms you were on, turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world.
Finn: How did we miss that?
Holley: They've been scrambling everyone's satellites. The Americans actually discovered it just before you did. They placed an agent on that platform under deep cover. He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation.
Finn: [as they come out of the elevator] Great. Well, who is it? Has anyone seen the photo yet?
Holley: Nope, not yet. The American is here tonight to pass it to you. He'll signal you when he's ready.
Finn: Good, good. [sees Zündapp, Grem and Acer down below watching at Axlerod from another floor, as Rod in his Gremlin disguise comes to them] Oh, no.
Holley: What is it?
Finn: Change of plan. You're meeting the American.
Holley: What? Me?
Finn: Those thugs down there were on the oil platform. If they see me, the whole mission is compromised.
Holley: No, no, I'm technical. You see, I'm in diagnostics. I'm... I'm not a field agent.
Finn: You are now.
[The screen shows Mater driving around, whistling, and it is shown that he is carrying a lot of drinks.]
Mater: [grabbing another drink from a waiter as he goes up a spiral ramp] I'll take one of them. Thank you. Never know which one McQueen will have a hankering for. [coming to one of the stands, where Daisu Tsashimi is one of the chefs] Hey. What you got here that's free? [notices some wasabi] How about that pistachio ice cream?
Daisu: No, no, wasabi.
Mater: Oh, same old same old. What's up with you? That looks delicious!
[Daisu gives a little piece of wasabi]
Mater: Er...little more, please. It is free, right? [as Daisu puts more and more on] Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go. It's free. You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop. [as Daisu puts a whole scoop of wasabi on the box] There ya go! Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
Daisu: [in Japanese] お悔やみもしあります。 (My condolences.)
Axlerod: And now our last competitor. Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
McQueen: [poses and shines his right headlight] Ka-chow! Thank you so much for having us, Sir Axlerod. I really look forward to racing. This is a great opportunity.
Axlerod: Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning. You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition.
Mater: AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! [rushes to the water fountain behind McQueen and Axlerod] Somebody get me water! [drinks the water] Aah! Oh, sweet relief! Sweet relief. [mutters]
Francesco: [chuckles]
Mater: [through the microphone] Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream! It has turned! [the word "turned" echoes]
McQueen: Sir Axlerod, [stutters] I can explain. This is Mater. He's...
Axlerod: No, I know him! [taps Mater] This is the bloke that called in to the television show. You're the one I have to thank.
Mater: No, thank you. This trip's been amazin'!
Axlerod: [notices that there is some oil beneath him and Mater] Ah! He's a little excited, isn't he?
McQueen: Mater!
Mater: But wait, I... Oh, shoot!
McQueen: Mater!
Axlerod: Has anyone got a towel?
McQueen: Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself! You're making a scene!
Mater: But I never leak oil. Never.
McQueen: Go take care of yourself right now!
[Mater leaves, while a staff member is seen wiping the oil. He and Axlerod both look towards McQueen, who gives a nervous smile while fainted.]
Mater: [coming through the crowd] Comin' through! Excuse me! Leakin' oil. Where's the bathroom? [as someone points to a hallway] Thank you. I gotta go. [comes to the doors, which he cannot understand the Japanese writing or stick figures] Oh, er... [stammers] Er... [goes into the ladies' toilets]
Ladies: AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
Mater: [drives out] Sorry, ladies. [drives into the men's toilets] I'm leakin'. [looks for an open toilet stall] I never leak. I never leak. I never leak, I never leak, I never leak. Oh, oh, I never leak. Oooh! [as someone comes out of a stall] I never leak, I never leak, never... [sees the design of a Japanese toilet] Wow-wee!
[Jaunty piped music is heard playing, and Mater starts to move forward, then gets pushed by the moving door.]
Mater: Oof! [as platforms around the toilet lifts him up] What in the...?
[Then a video screen appears, with a Japanese toilet assistant cartoon shown.]
Japanese Toilet Assistant Cartoon: [in Japanese] バスルームにようこそ。静かに座って、私たちは仕事をさせてください。これらのオプションのいずれかを選択してください。あなたはこのビデオを見ながらリラックスできます。 (Welcome to the bathroom. Please quietly sit down and let us do the work. Please choose one of these options. Relax while you watch this video.)
[While the cartoon is talking, clamps from the platforms grab onto Mater's rear tires, while the television screen then shows a picture of a waterfall. The clamps then lift Mater's rear tires up.]
Mater: Hey, that tickles! [unknowingly presses the bidet button]
Japanese Toilet Assistant Cartoon: [in Japanese] あなたの要求が受信されました。 (Your request was received.) [giggles as she feels water spraying onto her undercarriage]
[Suddenly, the water jets come out and spray water onto Mater's undercarriage.]
Mater: Waaargh! Aaaahh!
[Rod Redline, in his Gremlin disguise, drives into the bathroom. He then closes his eyes, taking his disguise off now appearing as a modern muscle car, and drives to a sink.]
Rod: Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's time for the drop. [turns on his status bar, and gives off a radar signal]
[Meanwhile, Holley is driving around the main room where the party is, when she hears beeping and looks on her left projection lamp to see the target located.]
Holley: OK, so, the American has activated his tracking beacon.
Finn: [through the radio] Roger that. Move in.
[Then Rod notices that Grem and Acer are behind him. Getting ready, he gets out his concealed gun from his wheel, as Acer then lunges at him. Rod makes one shoot from his gun, but Acer slams into him, knocking him into the corner, where Grem repeatedly rams him.]
Mater: [still being hit by water, repeatedly jabs different buttons on the control pad] Stop! Hey!
Japanese Toilet Assistant Cartoon: [giggles, and speaks Japanese, as the soap button is pressed]
Mater: Ah!
[Then robotic arms spray soap onto Mater and scrub him, causing him to babble. Grem then tries to ram Rod again, but Rod begins turning and makes a head-on collide with Grem, as Acer then pushes Rod towards the stalls. One of the stall doors begins to open as Mater tries to get out, but Rod gets rammed into the door, pushing Mater back in, with the robotic arms again scrubbing him. Meanwhile, Holley is following the map to the beacon on her projection lamp, as it makes beeping sounds.]
Holley: Oh, you've got to be joking.
Finn: What's the problem, Shiftwell?
Holley: He's in the loo.
Finn: [through the radio] So, go in!
Holley: I can't just go into the men's loo!
Finn: [through the radio] Time is of the essence, Shiftwell!
Holley: All right. [drives towards the hallway]
[Meanwhile, Rod is reversing towards the wall, then Acer charges again, but then the door of Mater's stall flings open, causing Acer to run into it. Mater then comes out.]
Mater: Oh! Whatever you do, I would not go in there! [door shuts and Mater sees Grem and Acer]
Acer: Hey!
Mater: A Gremlin and a Pacer! No offense to your makes and models, but you guys break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the...
[While Mater is talking, Rod uses a telescoping utility arm to attach a device with the photo of the mastermind's engine onto Mater's undercarriage.]
Mater: [feels pain from the device attaching to him] ...altar! What the...? [notices Rod, who is damaged] Whoa. Are you OK?
Rod: I'm fine.
Grem: Hey! Tow truck! We'd like to get to our private business here, if you don't mind.
Mater: Oh, yeah, sorry. Don't let me get in the way of your private business. Oh, a little advice. When you hear a giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button.
Grem: Thank you.
Mater: It's to adjust the temperature.
Acer: Got it!
Mater: And remember, it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.
Grem and Acer: Get out of here!
Mater: All right, then. And when she starts gigglin', prepare to be squirted!
[Holley then comes towards the door to the men's toilet, and is about to enter it when Mater comes out.]
Mater: 'Scuse me, ma'am. [drives away and then backfires] Oh! Dad-gum pistachio ice cream!
[Meanwhile, Holley notices on her projection lamp that the tracking beacon is on Mater.]
Holley: This cannot be him.
Finn: [through the radio] Is he American?
Mater: Look out, ladies! Mater's fittin' to get funky!
Holley: Extremely.
Finn: [through the radio] Then it's him.
Holley: [drives over to Mater] Hello.
Mater: Well, hello.
Holley: A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
Mater: Well, of course it doesn't. That's 'cause it's air-cooled.
Holley: Perfect. Erm...I'm from the Tokyo Station.
Mater: 'Course, Karmann Ghias weren't the only ones. Besides the Beetles, you had your Type 3 Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.
Holley: Yeah, OK. I get it.
Mater: And before both of them there's the Type 2 buses. My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
Holley: Listen! Erm... We should find somewhere more private.
Mater: Uh... Gee, don't you think that's a little, uh...?
Holley: Yeah, you're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised. So, when can I see you again?
Mater: Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
Holley: Got it. We'll rendezvous then.
[Then the screen shows Mater coming to McQueen and his team.]
McQueen: There you are. Where have you been?
Mater: What's a "rendezvous"?
Luigi: Er... It's like a date.
Mater: A date?
McQueen: Mater, what's going on?
Mater: Well, what's goin’ on is I got me a date tomorrow.
Guido: [speaks Italian] Non ci credo.
Luigi: Guido don't believe you.
Mater: Well, believe it. My new girlfriend just said so. [notices Holley in the distance] Hey, there she is. [waves to her] Hey! Hey, lady! See you tomorrow!
[Holley hears and sees Mater calling to her, but she just drives away.]
Guido: [speaks Italian] Non ci credo.
Luigi: Guido still don't believe you.
[The camera shows the lemons' lair from outside, near the Rainbow Bridge, as two combat ships are parked outside. Just after Grem starts talking, the camera shows inside the lair, where the lemons are surrounding Rod Redline, who is pulled to a magnet and has parking boots on his front tires.]
Grem: I gotta admit, you tricked us real good.
Acer: And we don't like being tricked.
Rod: [chuckles]
Acer: Hey! What's so funny?
Rod: Well, you know, I was just wearing a disguise. You guys are stuck looking like that!
[Unimpressed, Grem pushes a lever, turning the magnet off, and causing Rod to land on a small platform, where one of the lemons pushes a fuel tank of Allinol towards him.]
Rod: Allinol? Thanks, fellas! I hear this stuff is good for you.
Zündapp: [arriving from an elevator] So you think. Allinol by itself is good for you. [presses a button, which causes some cylinders attached to the platform to turn Rod's rear tires and make whirring sounds as his status bar shows his speedometer going up] But after microscopic examination I have found that it has one small weakness. When hit with an electromagnetic pulse, it becomes extremely dangerous.
Grem: [moving a camera forward] Smile for the camera.
Rod: Is that all you want? I got a whole act.
Zündapp: You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform. Now, you will witness what it really does.
Rod: Whatever you say, Professor.
Acer: [as a Pacer comes up with a TV screen showing a picture of Rod with a Japanese pink car while in disguise] You talked up a lot of cars last night. Which one's your associate?
Rod: Your mother. Oh, no, I'm sorry, it was your sister. You know, I can't tell them apart these days.
Grem: Could I start it now, Professor Z?
Zündapp: Go 50% power.
[Grem then pushes a lever beneath the camera that causes the lens to light up and make whirring sounds, going to 50% power.]
Zündapp: This camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter.
Acer: [showing Rod a picture of him with Shigeko] What about her? Did you give it to her?
Zündapp: The Allinol is now heating to a boil, dramatically expanding, causing the engine block to crack under the stress, forcing oil into the combustion chamber. [While Zündapp is talking, Rod's engine is heard cracking, then the oil is heard flowing.]
Acer: [showing Rod a picture of him with a Japanese red Ferrari at a sushi stand] How about him?! Did you talk to him?
Rod: [as smoke gets emitted from his tailpipes] What do I care? I can replace an engine block!
Zündapp: You may be able to, but after full impact of the pulse... [as Grem pushes the generator's lever to 75% power] unfortunately... there will be nothing to replace.
Acer: [showing Rod a picture of him with Mater in the bathroom] How about him? Does he have it?
[Rod trembles upon seeing the image, which Zündapp then notices and looks at the picture.]
Zündapp: That's him. He's the one.
Grem: Roger that, Professor Z.
Rod: No!
Zündapp: [through the telephone to the mastermind and their friend] Yes, sir. We believe the infiltrator has passed along sensitive information. [after the mastermind and their replied indistinctly] I will take care of it before any damage can be done. [hangs up] The project is still on schedule. You will find the second agent and kill him.
Rod: OWWW!!! OWWW!!!! OWWW!!!!! OWWWWWWW!!!!!!! OOOWWWWW-- [Zündapp then pushes the generator's lever to 100% power, which the screen then shows the picture of Rod and Mater, zooming in as a reflection of Rod is shown, shaking as the generator's electromagnetic pulse gets more powerful, before he finally explodes and dies. Parts of Rod flew as remains of his status bar flung all over the place.]
[The screen shows a distant view of Mount Fuji and a Japanese tower while the World Grand Prix theme music begins playing and Brent Mustangburger starts talking, then it shows Okuni, Shigeko, and Tamiko on a small bridge near the Tokyo Imperial Palace, before showing the first World Grand Prix race, with Brent Mustangburger, Darrell Cartrip, and David Hobbscap commentating as the racers get fueled up and do a formation lap.]
Brent: Japan, land of the rising sun, where ancient tradition meets modern technology. Welcome to the inaugural running of the World Grand Prix. I'm Brent Mustangburger here with racing legends Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap. There's never been a competition like this before. First, Allinol, making its debut tonight as the required fuel for all these great champions. Second, the course itself. And it's like nothing we've ever seen before. David, how exactly does this competition work?
David: Well, Brent, all three of these street courses are classic round-the-house racetracks. This means that the LMP and formula cars should break out of the gate in spectacular fashion. Look for Francesco Bernoulli, in particular, to lead early. And with the series of technical turns throughout, GT and touring cars, like Spain's Miguel Camino, should make up some ground but I doubt it'll be enough to stop Francesco from absolutely running away with it.
Darrell: Whoa now. Just hold your horsepower. You forget the most important factor here - that early dirt track section of the course. The dirt is supposed to be the great equalizer in this race.
Brent: French rally car Raoul ÇaRoule is counting on a big boost headed through there.
Darrell: And don't forget Lightning McQueen. His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time. In my opinion, McQueen is the best all-around racer in this competition.
David: Really, Darrell, I think you need to clean your windshield. You're clearly not seeing this for what it is: Francesco's race to lose.
Brent: It's time to find out. The racers are locking into the grid.
McQueen: [stretches his tires, and closes his eyes] Speed. I am speed.
Francesco: [laughs] Really? You are speed? Then Francesco is triple speed. [closes his eyes] Francesco is triple speed. [opens his eyes] Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen! It's-a really getting him into the zone!
McQueen: [to himself] He is so getting beat today!
[One set of red lights turns on one-by-one, before another set of lights beneath it turns green. The racers start the first lap, with Raoul ÇaRoule and Miguel Camino leading through the narrow streets of Tokyo, before Raoul gets overtaken by Max Schnell and Carla Veloso, and Miguel also gets overtaken by Jeff Gorvette, Shu Todoroki, Lightning McQueen, Francesco Bernoulli, Nigel Gearsley and Lewis Hamilton, with Rip Clutchgoneski behind him. McQueen and Francesco make their moves around Jeff, Carla, Raoul and Max, which Francesco takes the lead with McQueen behind him as they go around the first corner.]
Crew Chiefs: [mumbling to racers]
Sarge: Your suspension sets look good.
Luigi: Tire pressure is excellent!
Fillmore: He's got plenty of fuel.
Mater: And he's awesome!
Crowd: [chanting and clapping] McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
[The screen then shows Finn and Holley inside a building overlooking the racetrack, as they have eyes on Mater, who is wearing a headset.]
Holley: Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
Finn: It's his cover. One of the best I've seen, too. Look at the detail on that rust. It must have cost him a fortune.
Holley: [using her on-board computer dual trackball platforms] But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
Finn: There's probably heat on him. Be patient.
Holley: Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can.
Finn: And then we find out who's behind all this.
Brent: [announcing] As they head into the palace hairpin, Francesco builds an early lead.
Darrell: Ah, hang on, boys. Here comes the dirt. Slipping and sliding, baby.
Mater: McQueen, it's time to make your move! Get on the outside and show 'im what Doc done taught ya!
McQueen: 10-4, Mater.
David: [as Francesco struggles to brake on the dirt] Oh, boy! Francesco's brought to a screeching halt!
Brent: [as McQueen uses Doc's "turn right to go left" trick to overtake Francesco] Lightning McQueen is the first to take advantage. And just like that, folks, Francesco's lead is left in the dust.
McQueen: Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!
Darrell: [as some of the other racers are shown to have overtaken Francesco] Whoo-hoo! Man, McQueen looks happier than a roll bar at a demolition derby!
Brent: [after the rest of the racers get ahead of Francesco] Everyone's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again. Francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt.
[As they go into a tunnel on the asphalt, Francesco accelerates, making several moves around Miguel, Raoul, Rip, Nigel and Jeff before they come to a zigzag that is outside of the tunnel.]
David: Wow, he's got some serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race.
Brent: Now, the racers hit the Rainbow Bridge, with its 360-degree loop.
[As the racers go around the loop leading up to Rainbow Bridge, Francesco overtakes Lewis, who is then overtaken by Rip when they come onto Rainbow Bridge, as McQueen leads ahead of Carla and Shu, who are now ahead of Francesco after he overtakes Max. As they get onto another straight, Francesco overtakes Shu, as well as Carla a while before they come to the start/finish straight, with McQueen leading ahead of Francesco, as Lewis has already overtook Rip, who is ahead of Miguel and Nigel, with Jeff having got ahead of Raoul. Meanwhile, Grem and Acer are watching from a balcony with the electromagnetic pulse, and wearing headsets.]
Zündapp: [through the radio] It is time.
Grem: Roger that. [pushes the emitter's lever to 75% power, and aims it at Miguel, whose engine explodes upon being hit by the pulse]
Darrell: [as Miguel immediately comes into the pits] Oh! Miguel Camino has blown an engine!
Brent: Very unusual, Darrell. He's been so consistent all year.
Grem: [notices Mater in the pits] You gotta be kiddin’ me!
Acer: What is it?
Grem: It's the tow truck from the bathroom.
Acer: The one from the bathroom?
Grem: Yeah, the one the American agent passed the device to!
Acer: What about him?
Grem: What about him? He's in the pits!
Acer: Not for long! [drives away]
Holley: [hearing a bleeping sound on her on-board computer] Hold on. I think I've got something.
Finn: What is it?
Holley: It's the Pacer from the party last night. I'm cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks. [getting both photos together] Yep. His VIN numbers match.
Finn: Anyone with him? He won't be alone.
Holley: [scanning the lemons on and around the stands] Conducting analysis on the target. He's not the only one here. Three, five... They're everywhere. And they're all closing in on... [sees the camera on her computer centering on Mater] Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?
Finn: [having gone out of the building] Get him out of the pits! Now!
Mater: [hearing the racers' engines revving] Wow! Some of them fellers is really loud!
Holley: [through the radio to Mater] Can you hear me? Over.
Mater: Uh... What?
Holley: [through the radio] Get out of the pit now! Do you hear me?
Mater: Hey. I know you! You're that girl from the party last night. You wanna do our date right now?
McQueen: [hearing Mater through the radio] Guys, a little too much chatter. Let's keep this line clear.
Rip: (gets hit with the pulse emitter as Carla and Max watch in surprise) AH!!!
Brent: [as Rip spins after being hit by the pulse emitter] Smoke from number 10, Clutchgoneski!
Grem: Ha-ha-ha!
Holley: [through the radio to Mater] There's no time for messing about! You've got to get out of the pits!
Mater: Well, is there gon’ be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race?
Holley: [through the radio] You're running out of time!
Finn: [as he drives underneath the stands] They're coming, Shiftwell! Get him out of there!
Holley: I'm trying! [through the radio to Mater] Get out now!
Mater: [turning around and heading to the back of the pits] Well, I usually like to have a proper detailin' done before I meet a lady friend. [leaves]
[However, Acer and a blue Pacer named Petey Pacer already arrive at the shutter door.]
Mater: [seeing his reflection on a hood, notices something on his buck teeth] Huh?
[Acer then opens the shutter door, only to see Finn with a fire extinguisher, as Mater is behind another shutter door.]
Acer: Finn McMissile?! But you're dead!
Finn: Then this shouldn't hurt at all. [shoots foam from the fire extinguisher at the two lemons]
Acer and Petey Pacer: [both crying out as the foam gets shot over their eyes] Aaah!
[Finn then leaves with the two lemons following him while having their vision blocked by the foam. Just as they leave, Mater comes out of the pits, heading in a different direction. Finn makes a turn away from the stands, with Petey following him, followed by Acer. Petey then makes another left turn while Acer goes straight ahead, only for Petey to run into a police officer, who gets covered with foam. Petey gasps as he realizes who he is seeing, as the police officer sets off the siren, before the camera shows Mater driving through the streets, as other lemons follow on different roads.]
Finn: [through the radio] Miss Shiftwell?
Holley: I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages. Multiple assailants are closing in quickly.
Finn: Keep him moving. I'm on my way! [gets onto the roofs with his grappling hooks]
Mater: [noticing a flower shop] Hey, new lady friend, you like flowers?
McQueen: [hearing Mater] What?!
Holley: [through the radio to Mater] No! Don't go in anywhere. Just keep moving.
Mater: Stay outside. Got you.
McQueen: [hearing Mater] Outside? [moves to the outside of the loop heading to Rainbow Bridge]
Brent: Whoa! McQueen suddenly moves to the outside!
Francesco: [passing McQueen, speaks in Italian] Grazie di arrivederci! [accelerates]
Darrell: I cannot believe what I just saw, Brent. That was a bonehead move to open up the inside like that!
David: That move might have cost McQueen the victory!
[Mater then continues driving, as a red Gremlin named Tyler heads towards him. Finn, still up on the roofs, uses one of his grappling hooks to knock over a vending machine, causing it to smash on the ground in front of Tyler, as the florist, named Hans, wakes up upon hearing it smash. Believing that it is Tyler who broke it, Hans gathers up two assistants, and they all angrily speak in Japanese as they push Tyler away.]
Tyler Gremlin: Sorry!
[Finn then comes back on the ground, but then notices another lemon, named Fred Pacer, who rams him. He stops beside two other lemons, who join Fred to shield Finn and push him towards Acer, who is holding a flame-thrower.]
Acer: This time, I'm gonna make sure you stay dead! [puts on his welding helmet and makes his flame-thrower shoot out long flames]
Holley: [through the radio to Mater, who is on one of the minor roads that leads to Finn's scene] You're doing brilliantly. Now just stay focused.
Mater: What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus? [heads towards the road where Finn and the lemons are]
Holley: [through the radio] No! Don't go down that street!
[However, Mater still keeps on going, as the lemons continue to push Finn towards Acer's flame-thrower. However, Finn leaps free, causing the lemon behind him to move forward towards Acer, who turns the flame-thrower away from him. Meanwhile, Mater has just arrived.]
Towga Gremlin: Ohh! [crashes into Acer, with an explosion causing them to go up in the air]
[Acer lands on a chopstick sign, knocking over the food shape.]
Finn: [performing martial arts as the other lemons confront him] Hi-yah!
Mater: Wow! A live karate demonstration!
McQueen: Stop it, Mater! Just sign off.
[Finn then activates his front steel magnet wheels upon making them hit the ground, then throws Fred Pacer towards an elevator platform of a parking stack.]
Fred Pacer: Aaargh!
[Finn then shoots a cable which causes the elevator to go up, crushing Fred against the roof.]
David: [as McQueen closes the gap on Francesco and goes side-by-side] And here they come, the two leaders.
Brent: They're bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line!
[Meanwhile, the remaining lemon heads towards Finn, but Finn uses his steel magnet wheels to jump onto a wall and back on the ground as the lemon then barrels under the elevator platform, where Finn then shoots the winch cable, causing the elevator fall down onto the lemon, while Francesco and McQueen are just yards away from the finish line, at the end of lap 52.]
David: It's gonna be close!
Brent: [as Francesco and McQueen cross the finish line] Francesco's the winner! McQueen's number two!
[Fireworks then whizz and pop.]
[The screen then shows Finn again.]
Mater: That was cool! Hey! Can I get your autograph?
[Karate students then come out of a building, speaking in Japanese and driving past Mater, as other residents come out of the buildings after watching the race. Mater then looks around as the students drive past him, while Finn vanishes.]
Mater: [noticing that Finn has gone] Hey, where'd he go?
Holley: [through the radio] Our rendezvous has been jeopardized. Keep the device safe. We'll be in touch.
Mater: Dad-gum, did I miss our date? [heads back to the pits]
[The screen then moves up to show Finn on top of the elevator platform beside the corpses of the two lemons, before he then swings away with his grappling hooks.]
[The camera then shows McQueen, Francesco and Carla on the podium as they get interviewed.]
Photographer: Francesco!
Darrell: Francesco, over here. Hey, what was your strategy today?
Francesco: Strategia? Francesco needs-a no strategy! It's-a very simple. You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen to choke, pass him, then win. Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.
Darrell: I gotta tell you, dude, you were in trouble for a while. That dirt track section had you crawling.
Francesco: To truly crush one's dream, you must first raise their hopes very high.
[While Francesco and Darrell are talking, McQueen feels unhappy, then he notices Mater coming back to the pits. With no one noticing him, McQueen leaves and arrives in the pits, after Mater takes his headset off.]
McQueen: Mater!
Mater: Hey, McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right?
McQueen: Mater, why were you yelling things at me while I was racing?
Mater: Yellin’? Oh, you thought... Oh, that's funny right there. No, see, that's 'cause I seen these two fellers doin’ some sort of karate street performance. It was nutso. One of 'em even had a flame-thrower.
McQueen: A flame-thrower? What are you talking about? I... I don't understand. Where were you?
Mater: Goin’ to meet my date.
McQueen: Your date?
Mater: She started talkin' to me as a voice in my head, tellin' me where to go.
McQueen: What?!
Mater: Wait a minute. I didn't screw ya up, did I?
McQueen: I lost the race because of you!
Mater: Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
McQueen: An imaginary girlfriend?! Flame-throwers?! This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things!
Mater: Maybe if I, I don't know, talk to somebody and explained what happened, I could help.
McQueen: I don't need your help! I don't want your help! [drives away]
Nick Cartone: [noticing McQueen] Hey, there he is!
Male Reporter: McQueen, you had it in the bag!
Nick Cartone: Yeah! What happened?
McQueen: I...I made a mistake. But I can assure you, it won't happen again.
Reporters: [all shouting out]
McQueen: Look, guys, we know what the problem is and we've taken care of it.
Reporters: [continue shouting]
[Mater sadly watches at McQueen and sadly drives away]
Brent: [on TV] Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the first race of the World Grand Prix. And three - count 'em - three cars flamed out leaving some to suggest that their fuel, Allinol, might be to blame.
Axlerod: [being interviewed] Allinol is safe! Alternative fuel is safe! There is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out!
Darrell: Well, the jury may still be out on whether Allinol caused these accidents, but one thing's for sure, Lightning McQueen blew this race!
Brent: Team McQueen can't be happy right now.
[The screen then changes to show Mater sadly looking at the "Team McQueen" billboard while at the Tokyo Airport.]
[Then he leaves for a plane back to America, with the screen showing that Mater had removed his sticker of McQueen's racing number and lightning bolt.]
Announcer: [on PA] Welcome to Tokyo International Airport.
[As Mater heads to the check-in, Grem and Acer are shown watching him from the back of a queue. At the check-in, a traveler named Alex Vandel tries to get through the metal detector, but the alarm wails, as Officer Murakarmi checks for any metal on him. As Mater joins the queue, Finn arrives, disguised as a security guard.]
Finn: [speaks Japanese] Come with me, please, sir.
Mater: But I'm 'onna miss my plane.
Finn: [as they go through a smaller room] Right this way. [releases a spy camera from one of his wheels]
Mater: Ah, doggone it. This is about my hook, ain't it? I know I should have checked it, but I can't, really. [as they go into the waiting room] Look. It's attached to me.
[Finn turns his disguise off]
Mater: Hey, I know you. You're that feller from the karate demonstration.
Finn: I never properly introduced myself. Finn McMissile. British intelligence.
Mater: Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
Finn: Who are you with? FBI? CIA?
Mater: Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated. I know some karate. I don't wanna brag or nuttin', but I got me a black fan belt. Hey, you wanna see some moves I made up?
Finn: [hears a beeping sound and looks on his wing mirror to see through his spy camera that Grem and Acer are heading towards the room] You're being followed. [shoots a glass cutter at the window]
Mater: This first one, I can reach into a car's hood pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls. I call it, "What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once." [does karate moves, crushing an oil can] Hey! Hi-yah-pah! Hi-yah!
Grem: There he is!
Mater: Hi-hi-tah! Huh! [after Finn's glass cutter finishes cutting through the window] Look, I probably ought to go. I'm about to miss my flight. [starts to leave]
Finn: [grabbing Mater with his grappling hooks] Don't worry. I've taken care of that. [pulls him towards the hole in the window]
Mater: [being pulled] Whoa!
Finn: [jumping through the hole] Hang on!
Acer: [grunts]
Mater: Whoa-hah-hah! This is first-class service. You don't even have to go through the terminal!
Ucchi: 何やってんだよ？ (What are you doing?) [after seeing Grem and Acer going over the roof of boarding stairs and giving chase to our heroes along the runway]
Mater: Your karate partners is back there. They kinda look like they tryin' to catch up!
Finn: Drive forward. Whatever you do, don't stop! [spins around, making Mater go forward]
Mater: [as Everett, a passenger plane heads towards them] Whoa!
Everett: Whoa!
[Mater zigzags around the plane's wheels. Grem dodges the plane, and prepares to shoot a missile. Finn then releases a wheeled motorized jack, which comes to Grem and lifts him up at an angle.]
Grem: Whoa... [releases his missile, before being tipped over] Aah!
[Seeing that the missile is heading towards them, Finn releases another one at it, causing the two missiles to explode behind them.]
Mater: Is everything okay back there?
Siddeley: Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
Finn: [through the radio] Roger that.
[Acer is then shown pulling flatbed trolleys of baggage across the runway, blocking their path.]
Mater: 'Member that whole thing about me not stoppin' no matter what?
[Just then, Siddeley appears and shoots bullets at the flatbed trolleys to make some of them go up into the air and clear the path.]
Mater: Whoa! I knew I shoulda done carry-on!
Finn: [to Siddeley] Thanks, old boy!
Siddeley: [lands on the runway while still moving] You got it, mate. [opens his back ramp]
Mater: [seeing Holley inside] Hey, doggonit! Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!
Holley: Come on! Get in here!
Mater: I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya? [as Holley watches with a shocked face] That's a no-quit attitude right there!
[Suddenly, gunshots are seen beside them.]
Mater: What the...?
[Behind them, Acer is chasing them, trying to shoot them. One of the bullets then deflates one of Siddeley's tires.]
Siddeley: [being turned to the left and across the grass] Aargh!
Finn: Hold on, Sid!
[Siddeley then stops turning and goes straight along another runway, while Acer still keeps trying to shoot bullets at them. Finn then pulls out his gun and fires back, deflating Acer's front right tire.]
Acer: Aargh!
[Acer is then turned towards boarding stairs through an airplane, where two waitresses notice him going through the air, before he comes out the other side and falls into a lavatory service truck's tank of car waste, making a muffled cry. Siddeley then lifts his bodywork up, as he hits some signs showing the airport's barriers up ahead]
Siddeley: Come on, Finn! It's now or never!
[Finn then spins around so that he is going forwards.]
Mater: Whoa!
[Quickly, Finn heads into Siddeley with Mater behind him.]
Siddeley: Hold on! [takes off just before he can hit the barriers]
[Mater's voice is then heard before the screen shows McQueen, Luigi, Guido, Sarge and Fillmore reading a letter from Mater written by him while inside a hotel. Luigi and Guido are both sobbing while having large pupils in their eyes like Japanese anime characters.]
Mater: [through text on a letter] By the time you read this, I will be safely on an airplane flying home. I'm so sorry for what I did.
McQueen: [reading the letter] "I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. I want you to go prove to the world what I already know. That you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world. Your best friend, Mater." I didn't really want him to leave.
Guido: [sobs]
Luigi: Wait, there's more here. [moves the letter aside to see more notes, and reads the first one] "PS. Please tell the hotel I didn't mean to order that movie. I thought it was just a preview and I didn't realize I was paying for it." [moves the note aside to read the next one] "PPS. That's funny right there. PP." [moves it to see two notes with P.P.P.S. and P.P.P.P.S.] There are a few more pages of PS's here.
McQueen: Well, a-at least I know if he's at home, he'll be safe.
Finn: Now that's how I like to start the day. You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead.
Holley: Yeah. I hope that device didn't fall off. [presses a button on her seat to turn Mater's seat around and move the backrest down, seeing that the device is still on his undercarriage]
Mater: Whoa! Oh-oh-oh! That's the closet I ever been to missin' my flight. That was... [exclaims as Holley pulls the device off him with her telescoping utility arm] Oh!
Holley: [checking on the device] Still in one piece? Great. [goes to a mainframe computer and plugs the device in, which the computer says "Decrypting"]
Mater: Boy, I've got to go to a doctor. I keep gettin' these sharp pains in my undercarriage.
Holley: Downloading the photo now.
Mater: Hey, let me introduce you two. This here is Finn McSomethin' or other. He's a first-class VIP airport whatchamacallit. And, Finn, this here is my date.
[as Holley looks confused at Mater's comment]
Mater: I never did get your name.
Holley: Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell.
Mater: It's Shiftwell. Holley...
[Suddenly, the decrypting finishes, and a projector in the ceiling moves along over the characters as the windows get covered. The projector then displays the photo in vertical as well as a thin green light beam going across the interior in the shape of a barrier and between Mater, Finn and Holley.]
Finn: Finally. Time to see who's behind all this.
Holley: [seeing the photo] What is this?
Mater: Well, that's one of the worst engines ever made. It's an old aluminium V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts. [as Holley turns the photo into a horizontal position] Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.
Holley: Yes, OK, right, but whose engine is this, Mater?
Mater: Well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it?
Holley: But you're the one who took it.
Finn: Holley.
Holley: Oh. Right! Yes, of course. A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed. Sorry.
Mater: Agent? You mean, like, insurance agent? Like... [sings] ♪ Like a good neighbor, Mater is there! ♪ Wait! You mean secret agents! You guys is spies!
Finn: Holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?
Holley: [getting up the stats] It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine.
Mater: [moves his seat closer to Holley and across the light beam] You're purty.
Holley: Yes, alright, thank you.
Mater: And so nice.
Holley: Just pay attention. [moves the light beam so that it is between them]
Finn: This seems like a dead end.
[Mater tries to get a view of Holley, but she keeps dragging the photo to block his sight, then makes the photo bigger.]
Finn: If there was something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit, I'd be a lot happier.
Mater: You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is. See how he's had most of his parts replaced? And see all them boxes over there? Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by.
Holley: Rare parts?
Finn: That's something we can track.
Holley: Exactly!
Finn: [as the projector turns off and the windows open] Well done, Mater. I would never have seen that. I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife, but he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is. Mater, what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one?
Mater: Wait. What?
Finn: That's right. And you obviously have plenty of experience in the field, Mater.
Mater: Well, yeah, I live right next to one. I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently.
Finn: You're helping me. Please, Mater.
Mater: Well... Okay. [to Finn] But you know I'm just a tow truck, right?
Finn: Right. And I'm just in the import-export business. Siddeley?
Siddeley: Yes, Finn?
Finn: Paris! Tout de suite.
Mater: Yeah, two of them sweets for me, too, Sid! [to Holley] And you know, I always wanted to be a spy.
Holley: Really? Me, too.
Siddeley: Afterburners, sir?
Finn: Is there any other way?
[Siddeley then uses his afterburners, before the screen then shows different moments in Paris, first with our heroes at the roundabout around the Arc de Triomphe, where Mater is struggling to find a gap in the traffic on the roundabout without colliding, as the cars behind him toot and shout at him. Next, an organ grinder is seen playing at the Notre-Dame Cathedral, before the screen shows our heroes crossing the Pont des Arts, as Mater turns around and drives backwards as he watches two cars named John and Nancy kissing each other on the bridge. Then it shows an artist, Henri Motisse, who is painting a portrait of two cars named Lubewig and Geartrude in front of the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, but they both have an expression slightly different to on the portrait. At the Louvre Museum, our heroes arrive, as some birds fly away due to Mater getting too close to them.]
Mater: [just as the birds fly away] Ha ha ha!
[They then continue driving through the streets of Paris, past Gastow's restaurant. The screen then shows Mater watching a mime named Louis LaRue performing in front of some cars at the Eiffel Tower, before he then catches up with Finn and Holley. The camera is then shown in the air above the buildings, as Mater hides behind skips and pallets as he follows Finn and Holley.]
Finn: Once we're inside, stay close. Don't bother checking VIN numbers with criminal records. They're all dodgy here.
Holley: No VIN scans. Got it.
Finn: Don't talk to anyone, don't look at anyone, and absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear?
Holley: Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.
Finn: Mater?
Mater: [hiding behind a skip] Yeah, Finn?
Finn: We're not here to go shopping.
Mater: Shoppin'? What do you mean? Why would I... [as they go around the corner, he notices a market] Dad-gum!
Market Sellers: [shouting]
Mater: You gotta be kiddin' me. They got everything here. No! Look at them hoods! I could use a hood. [hears a horn reminding him what he's there to do] Sorry, fellers. I gotta go! [as he sees the different market stalls] Oh-oh-oh! Wow. Whoa. He-he! [stops next to a peculiar stall] Do what? [to the vendor] Excuse me. What are you selling?
Celine Dephare: [opens her eyes, which are in her headlights] Headlights, monsieur, headlights?
Mater: [gasps] What in the...? Ew! [drives away]
Celine Dephare: Two for one! I give you good price!
Mater: [leaves] It's OK! I'm good, I'm good!
[Finn then rounds a corner along with Holley, but quickly hides when seeing Tomber talking to someone while in French.]
Finn: [turns his wing mirror to get a sight of Tomber] There you are.
Mater: [rounding the corner] Man, there is some great bargains here!
Finn: Mater, get back!
Tomber: [hearing Mater] Imbécile!
[Tomber turns around to see who is there. Mater then hides, but Tomber looks closer, and upon seeing Finn's reflection on some hubcaps, he quickly flees, as Finn and Holley chase after him.]
Mater: Hey, wait for me!
[Tomber whizzes down a narrow aisle as Finn and Holley try to get to him. Tomber then knocks over a support for a stall roof, causing it fall down and form a ramp, which Finn goes over it. Holley then gasps as she sees what is ahead, and makes a sharp turn followed by Mater. Tomber then accelerates away from Finn, but suddenly notices Holley stopping in front of him. Tomber tries to brake, but then flips over.]
Tomber: Ahhhhhh! [lands in a tire stall, then gets zapped by Holley's electroshock device] Ag-g-g-h!
Finn: [stops Holley] Have you lost your mind?!
Holley: But I thought...
Finn: Mater, this chap needs a tow. Hook him up.
Mater: Well, sure thing.
[Finn and Holley then drive towards a garage, as Mater tows Tomber.]
Tomber: [as Mater tows him] You rusty piece of junk! Get your dirty hook off me!
Finn: [speaks in French to a car in the garage] Allez! Maintenant - vite! (Come on! Now - quickly!)
[The car in the garage then flees, as Holley, Mater, and Tomber enter. Tomber then talks angrily in French, then Finn closes the garage door so to keep anyone from coming in.]
Tomber: [as he gets released by Mater] Electroshock! Are you kidding me?!
Finn: Easy, Tomber. This is her first field assignment. She didn't know you were my informant.
Holley: Informant?
Tomber: A rookie, huh? I never liked new car smell.
Holley: [grumbles]
Finn: Tomber was doing 20-to-life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly.
Tomber: Speaking of recalls, you're getting up there in mileage, aren't you, Finn?
Holley: All right, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old. So, here you go, informant. Inform us. [turns on her on-board computer and dual mounted trackball platforms to show the engine photo]
Tomber: Beuck! That is the worst motor ever made. [gasps] Wait. That oil filter. Those wheel bearings.
Finn: Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?
Tomber: They should. I sold them.
Holley: To whom?
Tomber: No idea. He's my best customer, but he always does his business over the phone. I was always wondering why he needs so many parts. Now I know.
Mater: Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't nothin' truer than that.
Finn: Lemon?
Mater: Yeah, you know. Cars that don't ever work right. Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport.
Finn: Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out there.
Holley: Right. Let's see. Um... There were Hugos and Trunkovs.
Finn: Mater, are these cars considered lemons?
Mater: Is the Popemobile Catholic?
Holley: Finn, everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars.
Finn: And they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine.
Tomber: Ah! This explains it.
Finn: What, Tomber?
Tomber: Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkov never get together, but they are having a secret meeting in two days.
Finn: Where's this meeting taking place?
Tomber: Porto Corsa, Italy.
Mater: That's where the next race is!
Finn: Then there's a good chance our mystery engine will be there, too.
Tomber: Your chances are more than good. I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday... to Porto Corsa.
Finn: Holley, contact Stephenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good work.
[The screen then shows Stephenson, a bullet train, speeding along the track to Porto Corsa, before showing Mater, Finn, and Holley watching a video feed of the lemons crossing a crossroad in Porto Corsa in different groups representing each car model, as members painted black surround a different colored member. After the Pacers cross the crossroad, the traffic lights on the lemons' road turn red, but the lemons keep going, with several of the members in the Trunkov and Hugo groups angrily moving the traffic on the other road aside when they try to get across, despite the fact that the lemons are actually crossing at a red light.]
Mater: Boy, I'll tell you what. That three-wheeled feller had to be right about a big meetin'. You never see this many lemons in one town. 'Less there's a swap meet or somethin'. [to Holley] Hey, how'd you get all them pictures?
Holley: Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans.
Mater: Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car I ever met, but you the smartest, too.
Holley: Thank you...I think.
Mater: [noticing a blue tow truck towing a yellow Hugo in the Hugo group] That's a familiar sight. A Hugo being towed. But he looks absolutely perfect!
Finn: Of course! They must be the heads of the lemon families.
Mater: Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day, I'd hire me to tow me around all the time, too!
Finn: We've got to infiltrate that meeting. It's the only way to find out who's behind all this.
Holley: Hang on a minute.
Mater: What?
Holley: Hold still. [takes a picture of Mater]
Mater: [affected by the flash of the camera] Ow!
[Holley then connects her telescoping utility arm into the monitor, and moves the image of Mater's front over the blue tow truck, as well as making it turn to blue, showing that they look similar.]
Finn: Ah-ha. Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
Holley: Thank you, Finn.
Mater: Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now.
[The screen then shows the Italian village, Carsoli, as Team McQueen arrive at the piazza.]
Luigi: Guido, your eyes do not deceive you. We are in Italy! We are home!
Fillmore: Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel, man?
Luigi: What?! No friend of mine will stay in a hotel in-a my village. You will stay with my... [notices who has come up beside him] Uncle Topolino-o-o-o!
Uncle Topolino: Luigi! Guido! [speaks in Italian as all of the village residents gather up]
[The camera then shows the town at sunset as a band plays music for a celebration. Fillmore and Sarge are drinking different types of fuel at a table.]
Sarge: How do they do it? These are the same ingredients as back home, but it tastes so good.
Fillmore: It's organic, man.
Sarge: [sighs] Treehugger.
Uncle Topolino: [to McQueen] Hey, race car! You look so down, so low. Is like you have flat tires.
Mama Topolino: [speaks Italian]
Uncle Topolino: She said you look like you are starving, that she's gonna make you a big meal and fatten you up.
McQueen: Oh, no. Uh, M-Mama Topolino, please, y-you don't need to make a fuss. [sighs as Mama Topolino drives into the building]
Uncle Topolino: Capisco. I understand. Is a problem, yes, between you and a friend?
McQueen: How did you know that?
Uncle Topolino: A wise car hears one word and understands two. That, and Luigi told me. [McQueen gives a smug look] While Mama cooks, come and take a stroll with me.
McQueen: I brought my friend Mater along on the trip and...and I told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs.
Uncle Topolino: This Mater, is a close friend?
McQueen: He's my best friend.
Uncle Topolino: Then why would you ask him to be someone else?
McQueen: [thinking for a moment] Oh... What did I do? I... I said some things during our fight, and...
Uncle Topolino: You know, back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me, they would fight over everything. They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari, which one of them looked more like a Ferrari. There were even some non-Ferrari fights. So I tell them, "Va bene, it's OK to fight. Everybody fights now and then, especially best friends. But you gotta make up fast. No fight more important than friendship."
[While Uncle Topolino is talking, Guido offers to dance with the female car, Franca, but Luigi then bumps in, causing Guido to move him away, before Luigi comes back over, which makes both of them argue with each other, until another female car, Francesca, comes along, and the two girls giggle as Luigi and Guido stop and smile at them. This leaves Luigi to dance with Franca while Guido dances with Francesca.]
Uncle Topolino: [speaks Italian] Chi trova un'amico, trova un tesoro. (Who finds a friend, finds a treasure.)
McQueen: What does that mean?
Mama Topolino: Whoever find a friend, find a treasure. Now, mangia. Eat!
[Uncle Topolino and Mama Topolino drive away, arguing in Italian.]
[The screen then shows Stephenson on his journey to Porto Corsa as Finn and Holley fit on Mater a beacon light that looks like his old one.]
Stephenson: Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.
Finn: Thank you, Stephenson.
Holley: Yeah, I think that should just about do it.
Finn: Perfect.
Holley: So, Mater, it's voice-activated. But, you know, everything's voice-activated these days.
Mater: What? I thought you was supposed to be makin' me a disguise.
Computer: Voice recognized. Disguise program initiated. [puts the holographic disguise on Mater]
Mater: [chuckles] Cool! Hey, computer, make me a German truck.
Computer: Request acknowledged. [puts lederhosen on Mater]
Mater: Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen. Make me a monster truck!
Computer: Request acknowledged. [turns Mater into Dracula, complete with fangs, having misunderstood that he actually meant a truck with giant wheels]
Mater: What the...? [chuckles] [acting out as Dracula] I vant to siphon your gas! Ha-ha! Now make me a taco truck!
Computer: Request acknowledged. [turns Mater into a white taco truck, with his horn playing "La Cucaracha"]
Mater: A funny car!
Computer: Request acknowledged. [turns Mater into a yellow funny car, which Mater then makes revving noises]
Finn: [turns Mater back to normal] The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater. [presses a button to put the holographic disguise on Mater]
Mater: So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.
Finn: And leave the rest to us.
Holley: [to Mater] Now, hold still. [presses a button] First, I have to do the final fitting on your disguise.
[A computer then shows that the surface of the disguise does not match Mater's surface, due to the number of dents on his body.]
Holley: Oh, dear. That's no good. Hm. [presses a button]
Mater: [notices a robotic sander closing in on him] Hey! What are you doin'?
Holley: The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.
Mater: Oh, for a second there, I thought you was tryin' to fix my dents.
Holley: Yes, I was. [presses a button to move the sander away]
Mater: Well, then, no, thank you. I don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody. They way too valuable.
Holley: Your dents are valuable? Really?
Mater: I come by each one of 'em with my best friend, Lightning McQueen. I don't fix these. I wanna remember these dents forever.
Holley: So, you were being serious in Paris? McQueen isn't just part of your cover?
Finn: Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, everyone.
Mater: But my line of work is towin' and salvage.
Finn: Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.
Mater: No, I meant for real. I...
Holley: No, no, it's OK. Say no more. I'll work around the dent.
Mater: Oh...
Finn: [to Mater] In the meantime... [presses a button to reveal hundreds of weapons inside the train] ... you look a little light on weapons.
[The screen then shows Stephenson coming out of a tunnel and arriving at Porto Corsa. The screen then changes different times while Brent, Darrell, and David begin commentating with the Italian version of the World Grand Prix theme music playing in the background.]
Brent: You are looking live at beautiful Porto Corsa, Italy, on the Italian Riviera. What a magnificent setting for the second race of the World Grand Prix!
David: Well, Brent, they call this place the "Gem of the Riviera," and it's easy to see why. With its secluded beaches and opulent casinos, Porto Corsa truly is a playground for the wealthy. And everyone who's anyone is here today, from the ultra-rich and super-famous to world leaders and important dignitaries.
Darrell: You aren't kidding, David. You can't do a three-point turn around here without bumping into some celebrity!
Brent: Welcome, everyone, to the second race of the World Grand Prix, where the big news continues to be Allinol. Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety.
Axlerod: [being interviewed] An independent panel of scientists has determined that Allinol is completely safe, okay? Safe! There it is.
Brent: So the race will go on, folks.
Darrell: But the question everyone is asking: will the real Lightning McQueen show up today?
Brent: Well, he'd better. Talk about a home track advantage. Francesco Bernoulli grew up racing on this course.
Italian Announcer: [as the racers line up on the grid] Signore e signori (Ladies and gentlemen), in the pole position, numero 1, Francesco!
Francesco: Bellissima! (Beautiful) Thank you for your support! And your big mistake, McQueen!
Italian Announcer: [as the Pope is shown attending the race with his bodyguards] In secondo position, numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!
Luigi: [seeing that McQueen feels sad] McQueen-a, is-a everything OK?
Fillmore: If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't. It's perfectly safe.
McQueen: No, guys, I just really wish Mater were here.
Francesco: Francesco understands, McQueen.
McQueen: Oh, great, here it comes. What do you got, Francesco?
Francesco: For famous race cars like Francesco and, well, you, to be far away from home is not easy.
McQueen: I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult.
Francesco: Is-a no insult. When-a Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama, just like-a you miss your tow truck amico.
McQueen: Gee, [stutters] I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly...
Francesco: Of course, I am at home, and my mama is right here. [points to his mother, who is blowing kisses to him in the crowd] Mama! [chuckles] Don't worry, Mama, McQueen is very sad. I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!
McQueen: And there's the insult we were missing. Grazie.
Crowd: [chanting] Forza, Francesco! Forza, Francesco!
[The red lights then come on, before the green lights show up, and the racers set off, with Francesco leading in front of McQueen.]
Brent: Darrell, the racers are settling in as they head to the Italian countryside.
Darrell: Whoo, boy! This is gonna be a great race!
[The screen then shows the Casino di Porto Corsa, where the Gremlins are about to enter. A couple of cars come out, tooting their horns as one of the black Gremlins pushes them aside until the other Gremlins go inside. The blue tow truck, named Ivan, is waiting for Victor Hugo with the black Hugos. One of them is named Alexander Hugo.]
Alexander: Gremlins. Man, those are some ugly cars. Look like someone stole their trunks!
[Alex, Ivan and the other black Hugos laugh. Just then, Holley shows up, as part of the plan to switch Ivan with Mater, who is around the corner of the casino. Meanwhile, Finn is at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds.]
Holley: [Italian accent] Scusatemi, tutti. Signori. Mio nonno. (Excuse me, everyone. Gentlemen. My grandfather.) My grand-a father has-a broken down. If-a one of-a you would help, I would be so thankful.
Ivan: Sounds like you need some roadside assistance.
Alexander: She was talking to me, Ivan!
Ivan: Oh, really? Prove it! [hits Alexander Hugo]
Holley: [still Italian accent] No, no, no! Don't-a fight over me. Signore Tow Truck, per favore.
Finn: [through the radio] Get ready, Mater. You're on any moment now.
Mater: I don't know about this, guys, Finn. What if I screw things up?
Finn: [through the radio] Just apply the same level of dedication you've been using to play the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.
Mater: It's just that them guys look purty tough and... Wait, did you say "idiot"? Is that how you see me?
Finn: [through the radio] That's how everyone sees you. Isn't that the idea? I tell you, that's the genius of it. No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool. Brilliant!
[While Finn is talking, Mater looks at his reflection on one of the casino's windows.]
[Then suddenly, he looks to the left to see Holley at the same corner tasing Ivan, then she notices that Mater has not got his disguise on.]
Holley: Why aren't you in disguise?
Mater: I er...
Holley: Come on! There's no time! Go!
Mater: OK. OK. Uh, computer, disguise!
Computer: Request acknowledged.
[Mater's disguise is then turned on, and he rushes to the front of the casino, where the black Hugos are waiting. Then a horn is heard.]
Alexander: It's the boss. He's coming.
[A luxury transporter named Karl Haulzemoff pulls up, and opens his trailer door, where Victor Hugo stands.]
Victor: Ivan!
[Mater just stands there, until Alexander hits him.]
Mater: Oh, er... [rushes to Victor]
Victor: Ivan, why do you insult me so by making me wait here?
[Mater then hooks up to Victor and tows him into the casino, followed by the other Hugos, while Karl leaves. Holley then joins Finn, turning on her on-board computer.]
Holley: He's in.
[Meanwhile, the race is still continuing, as McQueen attempts to get past Francesco, but backs out as they come to a hairpin similar to the Fairmont Hotel hairpin, with Carla, Shu, Max, Lewis, Nigel, Jeff, Raoul, Miguel and Rip.]
Brent: The racers are now making their way around the hairpin and headed downhill toward the casino bridge.
[The screen continues to show the racers as they make their way to the casino bridge, which is a viaduct around the casino. Inside the casino, cars are seen playing games.]
Casino Pitty: No more bets, please.
Ferrari Dealer: [throws dice] Come on, fuzzy dice!
Casino Pitty: Number four. Easy four.
Ferrari Dealer: Yeah!
Mary Esgocar: Air freshener. Antenna balls. Spark-a plugs.
Mater: [identifying different games around the casino with a HUD put into his eyes] Wow! This place looks like it's made outta gold!
Holley: [through the radio] That's because it is, Mater. Now, be careful what you say.
Mater: Why is that? What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"? So you want me to stop talkin' to ya right now?
Alexander: You are acting strange today, Ivan.
Mater: [identifying Alex] I have no idea what you're talking about, "Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex." Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex. But I guess that makes sense, seein's how you's wanted in France, Germany, Czech Republic...
Holley: [while Mater is mentioning where Alex is wanted] Mater, stop it!
Alexander: OK, OK, keep your voice down! You gonna make me arrested! [whispers to another Hugo] Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in a bad mood.
Finn: He's so good!
[Two members of casino staff open the doors to a smaller room, where the other lemons are. Mater gets shocked as he sees them all, having the leaders identified on his HUD showing the countries they are wanted in.]
Vladimir: Victor!
Tubbs: Hey, Victor!
J. Curby: There you are!
Vladimir: Come in! Come in!
J. Curby: Victor Hugo, I'm J. Curby Gremlin. From Detroit. It's good to see you!
Victor: [after getting unhooked by Mater] Is the big boss here yet?
Vladimir: No, not yet.
Tubbs: He's supposed to be here any minute.
[Suddenly, knocking sounds and a beeping horn are heard from behind the closed doors, as everyone watches shockingly.]
Finn: Here we go.
[The casino staff open the doors, and Zündapp turns up.]
Zündapp: Guten Tag.
Tubbs: Ah, it's just the professor.
Victor: Zündapp! When is he coming?
Zündapp: He's already here.
[The staff leave as they close the doors, as a screen comes down from the ceiling and shows the mystery mastermind with his hood open.]
Axlerod: [in disguised voice] Welcome, everyone. I wish I could be with you on this very special day, but my clutch assembly broke. You know how it is.
Tubbs: [as all the heads nod] Been there.
J. Curby: Forget about it!
Vladimir: We know how you feel.
Finn: [to Holley] Descramble that voice.
Holley: I'm trying. Oh, it's too sophisticated!
Axlerod: We are here to celebrate. Today, all your hard work pays off. The world turned their backs on cars like us. They stopped manufacturing us, stopped making our parts. The only thing they haven't stopped doing is laughing at us. They've called us terrible names: jalopy, rust bucket, heap, clunker, junker, beater, wreck, rattletrap, lemon. But their insults just give us strength. Because today, my friends, that all ends!
[While the mastermind is saying the last sentence, more televisions appear and show coverage of the race as Carla Veloso is shown. Suddenly, her engine blows, emitting flames and smoke and causing her to spin.]
Darrell: There's smoke on the casino bridge!
Mater: [gasps]
David: Oh, no!
Brent: It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car!
[Carla then skids straight into the wall on the viaduct.]
Finn: What just happened?
Holley: I'm working on it.
[All of the lemons begin to cheer, while Mater is shocked.]
Axlerod: They laughed at us, but now it's our turn to laugh back.
[Next, Nigel Gearsley's engine gets blown at the same spot, causing him to hit the wall as well.]
David: Another crash! It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley!
Axlerod: Embrace your inner lemon. Let it drive you.
Finn: Holley!
Holley: I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse. [sees the lemons' camera on top of the building] Finn, it's the camera!
Finn: Where?
Holley: On the tower!
[Finn rushes to stop the lemons.]
Axlerod: This was meant to be alternative fuel's greatest moment. After today, everyone will race back to gasoline. And we, the owners of the world's largest untapped oil reserve will become the most powerful cars in the world!
Lemons: Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo!
[While the mastermind is talking, medical tow trucks pull Carla and Nigel, while all of the cars around Porto Corsa see it on the screen, kick cans of Allinol away and begin leaving dirty marks all over the Allinol signs. Meanwhile, Finn is rushing through the traffic to get to the tower where Grem and Acer are.]
Finn: Get out of the way! Andate! (Go!)
[Noticing that the tower is in the distance, Finn, goes over rooftops and swerving past other cars along the roads. During the rush, there is a bus shouting in Italian at a car named Trike Feldman for blocking the road while selling Francesco merchandise, until they notice Finn a right turn past them.]
Axlerod: They will come to us, and they will have no choice, because they will need us.
[Finn then stops on top of a rooftop as he then notices Grem and Acer up ahead with the camera. Quickly, he drives towards them, but as he jumps towards the tower, he is stopped in midair, as Grem and Acer both turn around.]
Finn: Huh? [gets pulled up] Whoa!
[It is immediately shown that Zündapp's helicopter has got him with a magnet.]
Acer: Ha-ha! We figured you might stop by!
[Grem and Acer then resume their work as the helicopter pulls Finn away. Finn tries to wiggle free, but the magnet's force is too strong.]
Axlerod: And they will finally respect us! So hold your hoods high! After today, you will never again be ashamed of who you are!
[As the mastermind is talking, the racers are seen heading towards the casino bridge, and Grem then pushes the lever on the camera to go to 75% power and aim at Shu Todoroki as Finn cries out in horror.]
Finn: NO!!!
Axlerod: LONG… LIVE… LEMONS!!!!!
[Suddenly, Shu's engine explodes.]
Brent: Oh, number 7 is loose! Shu Todoroki!
[The explosion causes Shu to skid, and Miguel Camino tries to brake, but hits the back of Shu and slides across the racetrack. Max Schnell then attempts to brake, but he too fails and takes a massive impact, causing all three to block and career down the racetrack behind Francesco Bernoulli and Lightning McQueen, as all of the crowd gasps at the accident. Raoul ÇaRoule and Rip Clutchgoneski then try to brake, but they both get involved too. As they come around the corner to see the crash, Jeff Gorvette and Lewis Hamilton put on their brakes, and stop just in time. Meanwhile, Holley is watching.]
Holley: [gasps as she sees the helicopter taking Finn away] Finn?
[Meanwhile, McQueen and Francesco are fighting for the lead on the final lap, being lap 60.]
Brent: Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line! [as they cross the finish line] McQueen's the winner! Francesco's second! And they have no idea what happened behind them.
Francesco: Argh! This is impossible!
McQueen: That's what I'm talking about! Ka-chow! [shines his headlight at Francesco]
[Suddenly, several ambulances rush past while their sirens blare.]
McQueen: Wh- What happened? Where are all the other racers?
Francesco: What is going on?
[They look at the screen to see the huge pileup.]
McQueen: Oh, no!
[A chopper is then seen rushing towards the scene, as the press surrounds Axlerod.]
Brent: [on TV] Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London still going to take place?
Axlerod: [on TV] I suppose that... [sighs] Look, the show must go on, as they say. But now is not the time to talk about...
J. Curby: I can't believe this is really happening!
Vladimir: Shh! Quiet!
Brent: [on TV] And Allinol? Will you require all the racers to still run on Allinol?
Vladimir: [chuckles] Here it comes!
Axlerod: [on TV] I cannot, in good conscience, continue to risk the lives of any more race cars. The final race will not be run on Allinol.
Lemons: [cheering] Ah-ha-ha! Ha-ha! [continue cheering]
Brent: [on TV, to the TV viewers] There you have it, a clearly devastated Sir Miles Axlerod announcing that he will not require the cars to use Allinol for the final race.
Zündapp: [as casino staff pop lemonade corks] A toast! To the death of Allinol and alternative fuel forever!
Holley: [rushing away from the casino] Mater, abort the mission! They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now!
[Suddenly, she stops after turning a corner to see black Hugos in front of her.]
Holley: [gasps]
Ivan: How is your grandfather?
[Meanwhile, the lemons inside the casino are cheering, while Mater, who is now all on his own, is about to leave.]
Lemons: [chanting] Long live lemons!
Alexander: Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?
Mater: Oh, yeah, it's unbelievable.
Alexander: You are not leaving, are you?
Mater: Uh...of course I ain't leaving.
McQueen: [on TV] I'm just in shock like everybody...
Mater: McQueen?
McQueen: [on TV] Crashes are a part of racing, I know, but something like that should never happen.
Darrell: [on TV] They're letting you choose your fuel for the final race. Do you have any idea what it's gonna be?
McQueen: [on TV] Allinol.
Lemons: [all gasp] What?!
J. Curby: Did he just say Allinol?!
Darrell: [on TV] After today?
McQueen: [on TV] My friend Fillmore says the fuel's safe. That's good enough for me. I didn't stand by a friend of mine recently. I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Brent: [on TV] So a surprising revelation from Lightning McQueen. He will use Allinol in the final race, despite what occurred today.
Zündapp: [listening to the mastermind on the telephone] Yes, sir.
Axlerod: [through the telephone] ...till Lightning McQueen is dead!
Zündapp: Of course. [phone call ends] Allinol must be finished for good. McQueen cannot win the last race. Lightning McQueen must be killed!
Mater: No! [quickly backs up, and the emergency light gets bashed by one of the televisions]
[The bash causes the device to malfunction, as the disguise changes into taco truck form, with his horn playing "La Cucaracha" as several tacos fall out. It then cycles through his other forms: Dracula, funny car, lederhosen, before finally showing Mater's true form, as he nervously smiles. Upon seeing him, Zündapp gets a reaction.]
Zündapp: It's the American spy!
[Every lemon inside the room draw guns at Mater.]
Mater: Dad-gum!
Computer: Gatling gun. Request acknowledged. [gets gatling guns out of Mater's bodywork]
Zündapp: Down! Down! Everybody, down!
Mater: Shoot! I didn't mean...
Computer: Request acknowledged.
Mater: [as the guns start blasting out bullets] Whoa-oh-oh! Whoa!
[All of the lemons take cover, with some of them defending themselves with the table, as the bullets shoot the citrus fruit of the same name, then a statue's hair. Zündapp, J. Curby, Tubbs, Alexander, Victor, and Vladimir turn the table over to take shelter. A couple of other lemons then quickly evacuate as the bullets cause one of the TVs to almost fall on them. Mater then moves backwards and outside of the casino onto a balcony terrace, but the guns keep on shooting.]
Mater: Wait! Wait! I didn't mean that kind of shoot!
Computer: [deactivates the guns] Correction acknowledged. Deploying chute. [activates a parachute]
Mater: [being pulled away by the parachute] Whoa-oa! [sees McQueen onstage in the distance] McQueen! [spots a motorboat, and swings his tow hook towards it]
Boat: Whoa! What's this?! [accelerates]
Mater: Whoa! McQueen! McQueen!
[Suddenly, his tow cable comes off the boat, causing him to fall.]
Mater: Whoa! Aah! [hits the leaves of a palm tree, then a hotel sign, and is about to hit a market stall]
Market Seller: Waagh! [gets hit as the screen goes black]
[The screen then shows again to show security officers watching members of the press entering into the area where McQueen is. Suddenly, Mater comes up, covered in Francesco merchandise and palm leaves.]
Mater: Let me through! Let me through! You gotta let me in! I got to get through to warn McQueen!
Alex Carvill: You cannot-a come through here! Back up, signore!
Security Officer: [through a headset] We have a lunatic at gate 9.
Mater: No, listen! I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting and my weapons system's done misinterperated what I'm saying!
Security Officer: [through his headset] I repeat. Lunatic at gate 9.
Mater: [notices McQueen] McQueen! McQueen!
Fiat Fan: [as McQueen comes off the stage] You are the champion!
Peugeot Fan: Right this way, signore.
Mater: McQueen!
McQueen: Mater? [looks around, but there are photographers all around]
Mater: McQueen!
Photographer 1: Come over here, McQueen!
Photographer 2: Here! Come on!
Photographer 3: Give us a pose!
Mater: McQueen!
Alex Carvill: Back up, sir!
Security Officer: [as Mater backs up and starts to move about] Stop! Stop moving! Stop!
Alex Carvill: [as Mater head fakes them and drives through the railing] Hey! Hey! Hey! Where you going?! Oy! Stop! Ferma li!
[Mater continues driving, as the palm leaves and merchandise fall off him, before he stops behind the press, and tries to get into McQueen's sight.]
Mater: McQueen!
McQueen: Wait that really sounded like... [notices a flash of Mater's bodywork in the distance] Mater! Mater?
Peugeot Fan: Signore?
Mater: McQueen! They're gonna kill you!
McQueen: Mater! [gets his eyes temporarily blinded by a photographer flashing his camera light]
Peugeot Fan: ...signore, please!
McQueen: [stutters] Excuse me. [moves through the crowd]
Fiat Fan: No! No, where are you going?!
Peugeot Fan: Please, Mr. McQueen!
McQueen: Scusi. Mater!
Mater: McQueen!
McQueen: [getting through the crowd] Scusi. Mater!
Crowd: Come on!
McQueen: Mater! Mater, I'm so glad to see you! I'm so sorr...
[But as the rest of the photographers move away, Ivan appears in Mater's place.]
Ivan: Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.
McQueen: Oh! I'm sorry, I...I thought I heard...
Ivan: Yes, but that was me. I said, "You killed out there today. You're the best."
McQueen: What? Uh, I, I mean, thanks.
Peugeot Fan: Right this way, signore. [pushes McQueen in the other direction]
McQueen: I... I really thought I heard my friend.
Ivan: In England, you'll be finished! At the finish line. [moves away]
McQueen: Wait, what?
Press liaison 2: Please, uh, the world press is waiting. You come-a with me, please.
[Mater is shown to be captured by the lemons.]
[After Ivan made McQueen believe that it was him calling out, the screen shows that Mater has been captured by the lemons, making muffled cries due to a gag put over his mouth. The black Hugos move Mater into Karl's trailer, with a bump inside the trailer that causes one side of the gag to come off.]
Mater: Let me go!
Zündapp: You actually care about that race car. A pity you didn't warn him in time.
[The thugs then close the trailer door, and Mater gasps as he sees gas being sprayed into the trailer, making him unconscious. The screen then shows an image of Mater in a dream as he looks at his reflection on the same casino window.]
Mater: [voice] "Idiot"? Is that how you see me?
Finn: [voice] That's how everyone sees you. I tell you, that's the genius of it. No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool. At the fool... [echoes]
[As Finn's voice echoes, the image of Mater enters through the window, and notices the different moments from earlier with Team McQueen back in Tokyo.]
Mater: [at Kabuki-za] Hey, excuse me! [in Japanese] Domo arigato! Yeah! [taps on the glass to get Zen Master's attention] You done good. You got all the leaves!
Jeff: Check out that tow truck!
Lewis: I wonder who that guy's with.
McQueen: Will you guys excuse me just for one little second? [drives towards Mater]
Jeff: [giggles]
Mater: [at the sushi chef's stand] Now that's a scoop of ice cream! [takes all of the wasabi on his tongue, as his voice echoes]
Daisu: [in Japanese] お悔やみもしあります。 (My condolences.)
Mater: [feeling the heat of the wasabi] Aargh! [drives away as all of the guests around him laugh] [driving to the water fountain] Somebody get me water! [drinks some of the water] Aah! Oh, sweet relief!
McQueen: Mater! [turns to the crowd, who are all laughing at Mater]
Mater: Sweet relief.
Crowd: [laughs]
Grand Prix racers: [all laugh, with Francesco loudest of all, while Lewis, Jeff, and Rip are the quietest]
Mater: [after oil has been leaked on the stage] But I never leak oil. Never!
McQueen: Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself! You're making a scene!
Mater: [in the pits] Wait a minute. I didn't screw ya up, did I?
McQueen: I lost the race because of you!
Mater: Maybe if I talked to somebody...
McQueen: I don't need your help! I don't want your help! Your help... [echoes]
Mater: [banging the gong as random cars laugh] Bang the gong! Get it on!
McQueen: [voice] Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs. This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things! [while a bell is chiming] ...you have to get a hold of yourself! You're making a scene!
[Mater then wakes up, seeing himself tied up and hanging by a rope inside a room full of gears, as three loud chimes are heard from a bell. He then looks to see also tied up and hanging by a rope right next to him, Finn and Holley tied between one of the gears' teeth.]
Mater: Holley! Finn! Where are we?
Finn: We're in London, Mater, inside Big Bentley.
[The camera then zooms out to show the outside of the Great Elizabeth Tower, where Big Bentley is, with the clock saying 3 o'clock in the afternoon, then changes shot to show the tower next to the Houses of Parliament. Suddenly, the ropes holding Mater and the cages unwind.]
Mater: Whoooooa! [as the ropes stop] Whoa!
[The camera then shows that down below are rotating gears, which are supposed to crush Mater and the cages as their ropes and chains unwind slightly each minute, before showing the gear Finn and Holley are on nudging towards another gear, as the clock's minute hand moves to 3:01 P.M.]
Mater: Oh, this... This is all my fault.
Finn: Don't be a fool, Mater.
Mater: But I am, remember? You said so.
Finn: When did I... Oh. Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are.
Mater: [shouts angrily] I'M NOT A SPY!!!! [voice echos as Finn and Holley feel completely shocked] I've been trying to tell you that the whole time. I really am just a tow truck.
Holley: Finn, he's not joking.
Finn: I know.
Mater: You were right, Finn. I'm a fool. And what's happened to McQueen is 'cause I'm such a big one. This is all my fault.
[Then, they all notice Grem and Acer arrive in an elevator.]
Grem: [to Mater] Good. You're up.
Acer: And just in time!
Grem: [uncovers the EMP generator] Professor Z wanted you to have a front-row seat, for the death of Lightning McQueen.
Mater: He's still alive?
Acer: Not for much longer!
[Grem then aims the camera at the race course, through a panel on the clock face. Suddenly, the ropes holding Mater and the cages unwind slightly again.]
Mater: Whoa! [as the ropes stop again] Huh?
[Then the gear Finn and Holley are on nudges again, as the clock strikes 3:02 p.m.]
[Meanwhile, most of the World Grand Prix racers are putting on their tires to be prepared for the race. They have all chosen different fuels, as shown on the fuel tanks, while McQueen has an Allinol fuel tank. Sally, Ramone, Flo and Red had already arrived, while Sheriff and Sarge are absent, with Lizzie and Mack still in the United States.]
Sally: We came as soon as you called.
McQueen: I called to talk to Mater. It never occurred to me that he wouldn't be there.
Ramone: Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard right now.
Flo: And Sarge is in touch with his friends in the British military.
Sally: You just need to focus on the race.
McQueen: I...I know but, Sally with everything going on, I'm not sure I should...
[Suddenly, a horn is heard tooting, and McQueen turns to see Axlerod arrive.]
McQueen: Sir Axlerod.
Axlerod: I'm sorry to interrupt.
McQueen: No, no. It - it's all right.
Axlerod: I just wanted to come down here, and to personally thank you. Because after Italy, I was finished, and then you gave me one last shot.
McQueen: Listen, I...
Axlerod: I probably shouldn't be saying this at all, but I hope you win today. You show the world that they've been wrong about Allinol.
Sally: Mater would want you to race.
McQueen: All right. For Mater.
[The screen then shows Buckingham Palace, before Axlerod with the Queen and Prince Wheeliam, as the Queen waves a white flag, before the red lights at the pit straight turn on and change to the green lights, as the third version of the World Grand Prix theme music plays. Francesco gets in front of McQueen as they come towards Buckingham Palace along the Mall, followed by Miguel, Lewis, Max, Jeff, Nigel, Carla, Shu, Raoul, and Rip. Meanwhile, Zündapp, J. Curby, Tubbs, Victor, and Vladimir are watching from inside a glass-fronted building beside the start/finish line. The racers all go around the Victoria Memorial, then continue through the streets of London, before going through the different arches of Admiralty Arch. As the screen skips to the racers going around a bend, McQueen has got in front of Francesco, while Lewis has overtaken Miguel, Nigel ahead of Jeff and Shu ahead of Carla, and they all head towards Westminster Bridge, where Grem spots McQueen from inside Big Bentley. The clock reads around 3:09 P.M.]
Grem: Here he comes.
[Mater watches helplessly as the racers come onto the bridge, before Grem aims the EMP generator at McQueen, and pushes the lever up to 100% power, which is enough power to kill a car using Allinol. Mater looks down miserably as the generator gets up to full power, but when it does, McQueen does not explode, and continues around the corner.]
Zündapp: [through the radio] What happened?!
Grem: I don't know, Professor.
Zündapp: [continues talking as Acer and Grem argue]
Acer: What did you do?
Grem: I didn't do nothing! Ssh, I'm talking to the professor. Uh, what's that, Professor Z?
Acer: You broke it!
Grem: Quiet!
Zündapp: [through the radio] ...go to the back-up plan!
Grem: I understand, sir. Yes.
Acer: What did he say?
Grem: We go to the back-up plan.
Mater: Back-up plan?
Grem: We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.
Acer: The next time he makes a stop, instead of saying "ka-chow", he's gonna go "ka-boom"! [laughs along with Grem]
Grem: [as Mater feels angered] Don't feel bad, tow truck. You couldn't have saved him.
Acer: Oh, wait, you could have! [laughs along with Grem]
Mater: Dad-gum lemons!
Computer: Request acknowledged. [gets the gatling guns out of Mater, but the ropes are in the way, and the guns do not shoot]
Grem: [chuckles] What? You didn't think we'd take your bullets?
[Grem and Acer continue cackling as Mater then notices that the ropes have been slightly cut. He smiles, then immediately seals his mouth so to make sure Grem and Acer do not see what is happening. He even has his buck teeth hidden.]
Acer: That's right! You got nothing! [laughs along with Grem]
Grem: Who's the lemon now, huh? [laughs along with Acer as they leave]
Finn: Nice try, Mater.
Mater: Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum. [repeats "Dad-gum" continuously]
Computer: Request... Request... Request... Request...
[Then all of the ropes get completely cut, causing Mater to fall towards the gears.]
Holley: Mater!
Mater: Whoa!
[Luckily, he lands astride the gears and hurries across onto the gantry.]
[However, Finn and Holley are still tied to the gears.]
Mater: [to Finn and Holley] I gotta get y'all out of there!
Finn: There's no time! McQueen needs your help, Mater.
Mater: But I can't! I'm just a tow truck!
Finn: It's up to you. Go to the pits and get everyone out. You can do that.
Mater: What about you guys?
Finn: We'll be OK.
Holley: Go and get some more dents, Mater.
[With no other choice, Mater rushes off and out of the Great Elizabeth Tower onto the streets.]
Holley: So, we'll be OK? Really?
Finn: He wouldn't have left if I'd told him the truth. [the gear suddenly moves] Argh! Being killed by a clock. [chuckles] Gives a whole new meaning to "Your time has come."
Holley: Time? That's it! [notices an electric motor controlling the axle, and moves her front left tire past some of the ropes to shoot her electroshock device at it, but it fails to reach]
Finn: What are you doing?
Holley: Trying to turn back time. [uses her electroshock device again, but it misses
[Then the gear moves again, causing the thread of the screw to start pushing down on Finn and Holley.]
Finn: [as the gear moves] Argh!
Holley: [as the screw thread hits their roofs] Oof! If I can just reverse the polarity. [shoots her electroshock device again, and this time, it connects, zapping the motor, which makes the gears go in reverse and quicker]
Finn: Good job! Quick thinking, Holley!
[As the gears move backwards, the camera changes shot to show Great Elizabeth Tower's clock face with its hands moving backwards. Meanwhile, Mater is struggling to drive along the streets of London with oncoming traffic, not realizing that he is driving on the wrong side of the road in the United Kingdom.]
Mater: What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?
[The camera then shows Finn and Holley, before they then notice another gear on the other side which is about to crush them.]
Holley: Oh, no!
Finn: Drive! Burn rubber!
[They both drive forwards, making a gap big enough for the gear to go between and cut through the ropes, and they both land on opposite gantries.]
Finn: We've got to get to the course. Calculate the fastest way to...
[Then Holley retracts wings from her sides and rear deck.]
Holley: Done!
Finn: Oh. Miss Shiftwell.
Holley: They're standard issue now.
Finn: You kids get all the good hardware.
[As they prepare to leave, they then notice an air filter with a note saying, "If lost, return to Mater."]
Holley: Oh, no, that's Mater's.
Finn: I knew his escape was too easy.
[Using her retractable wings and flight afterburners, Holley flies out of a flip-up panel in the clock face, while Finn drives out through the tower's main entrance and onto the streets. During this, the clock's hands had already stopped at 2:56 p.m. Meanwhile, Mater heads toward the racetrack, and drive through a railing, as a couple of police officers notice.]
Police Officer: Come back here! Stop!
[Then the camera shows the start/finish straight, as Miguel and Carla are side-by-side, while Lewis is behind them. Mater then rushes down the pit lane to McQueen's pit stall, as all the other pit crews watch them pass.]
Luigi: Mater?
Mater: Everybody, get out! Get out now! Y'all gotta get out of the pits! [notices the other Radiator Springs residents] Hey, what are you guys doin’ here?
Sally: We're here because of you, Mater.
Flo: Is everything OK?
Mater: No, everything's not OK! There's a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get out! Now!
Sally and Fillmore: [in unison] A bomb?!
[Suddenly, Mater's communicator buzzes.]
Finn: [through the radio] Mater!
Mater: Finn! You're OK!
Finn: Listen to me! Mater, the bomb is on you! They knew you'd try to help McQueen. When we were knocked out, they planted it in your air filter!
[Mater then snorts, causing his air filter cover to come off and reveal the bomb inside, with digital text saying "REMOTE ON".]
Mater: [looks towards the Allinol fuel tank] Uh-oh.
McQueen: [coming down the pit lane] Mater! There you are!
Mater: Stop right there!
McQueen: Oh, man, I've been so worried about you.
Mater: Don't come any closer!
McQueen: Are you OK?
[Zündapp is about to press the detonate button on the remote.]
Mater: No, I'm not OK! Stay away from me! [reverses out of the pit lane]
McQueen: No, wait! Wait!
Brent: Hold everything! A tow truck has just raced onto the track, and he's driving backwards!
[Zündapp then hesitates, upon seeing this on the television.]
McQueen: Mater, wait! [drives after him, while the others watch]
David: Normally an emergency vehicle on the track means there's been an accident.
Brent: Wait, wait! Lightning McQueen is chasing him!
McQueen: Mater, wait!
Mater: Stay back! If you get close to me, you're gon’ get hurt real bad! [drives around the Victoria Memorial]
McQueen: I know I made you feel that way before, but none of that matters! Because we're best friends!
[The spectators, as well as the Queen and Prince Wheeliam, and all watch frowningly as McQueen tries to reason with Mater.]
Brent: And McQueen seems to be having a conversation with the tow truck.
Darrell: I don't know who that truck is, Brent, but I'll tell you what, he's got to be the world's best backwards driver.
Zündapp: [chuckles and moves his tire slowly towards the detonate button]
Mater: [turning around so to drive forwards] McQueen, you don't get it! I'm the bomb!
McQueen: Yes, Mater! You are the bomb! That's what I'm trying to say here! You've always been the bomb and you'll always be the bomb.
Mater: Stay away!
McQueen: No! Never! [goes even faster]
Zündapp: Almost there.
McQueen: I'm not letting you get away again! [grabs onto Mater's hook]
Mater: Gotta keep away from McQueen!
Computer: Request acknowledged. [makes rockets pop out of Mater's rear deck]
McQueen: Oh, my gosh!
[The rockets then activate, and McQueen ducks as the flames shoot out, making Mater go even faster. Zündapp then presses the detonate button, but the remote makes bleeping noises and says "Out of range". Zündapp then looks up to see on the television that Mater is going too fast for the remote to get into range with the bomb. Groaning, Zündapp repeatedly presses the button very quickly by millisecond. Mater then passes Francesco, who gets freaked out at what he sees.]
Mater: Aaaaaaaahhhhh!!!!
Francesco: What is happening?! It's a bad dream!
[Mater then drives through the barrier at the following curve and off the racetrack, as spectators get out of the way.]
Brent: Any Lightning McQueen just blasted away, hooked to the now rocket-propelled tow truck.
[While Brent is talking, Team McQueen see what has happened on the TV, as Mater and McQueen rush along the streets and through the traffic at a tremendous speed.]
Zündapp: [still repeatedly pressing the detonate button] Gargh! [grunts, then groans as he gives up, then sees Holley hovering in front of him] Huh? [sees Holley popping out her guns] AAGH! [turns around and breaks through the plate glass window, landing on top of a Globie inflatable display, before fleeing]
J. Curby: The professor's on the run!
Tubbs: Someone's gotta get McQueen!
Vladimir: Gah! Get McQueen!
Finn: Holley, I'll get Zündapp. You help Mater.
Holley: Got it!
Francesco: [as Holley flies past him] WHAT IS HAPPENING?!?!
[The screen then shows Zündapp as he rushes through the streets, almost causing a taxi and bus to collide into each other. Zündapp is then rushing along the South Bank on the riverside pathway and under Tyre Bridge, where he finds Tony Trihull, the battleship, at the other side on the River Thames.]
Tony: Hurry, Professor!
[Just then, Finn jumps off the bridge and onto the pathway, shooting his grappling hooks at Zündapp.]
Zündapp: [upon being hit by the grappling hooks] Aah!
Finn: [yanking Zündapp back] Argh! Do you really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor?!
[But Zündapp then drags forwards, and Finn strains as he tries to hold Zündapp back, but is unable to because Zündapp is being pulled by Tony's giant magnet. Zündapp's roof rack and monocle start getting attracted by the magnet, and Finn gets his deployable machines guns out, but they get pulled off by the magnet, which also pulls Zündapp's monocle. A couple of missiles then get pulled out of Finn's left headlight and stick to the magnet, then Tony prepares to shoot missiles at Finn. Meanwhile, Mater is still rushing through the streets with McQueen holding onto him.]
Mater: McQueen, let go!
McQueen: Never!
Blue Gremlin: [sees them going past, then talks through the radio to Grem and Acer] Hey, they're coming your way.
Grem: Let's go!
Acer: [cackles]
[Both Grem and Acer make a U-turn. Meanwhile, Tony is pointing the laser from his missile launcher at Finn, and shoots two missiles at him one-by-one, but Finn dodges them.]
Zündapp: Give it up, McMissile!!
[A few seconds later, Finn deploys a big number of small explosives, which all get pulled onto the magnet. Tony then looks at the magnet, and gets shocked as he sees the explosives flashing their lights and bleeping rapidly. The camera quickly changes shot to above the buildings as an explosion occurs, with water shooting up into the air. Holley then catches up to Mater and McQueen while in flight mode.]
Holley: Mater, stop!
Mater: No way! You could get hurt!
Holley: [gasps as she sees Grem and Acer up in the distance with their guns deployed] Oh, no.
[Mater and McQueen continue speeding through the streets, dodging the traffic ahead of them. As Grem and Acer close in on them, Holley comes down in front of them, causing them to slam into her and go up in the air to prevent them from killing Mater and McQueen.]
Grem and Acer: Aaaaahhh!
[They then crash into the Ye Turn Left Inn, where they knock down all of the tables, and spill drinks over the customers, who all get angered, and snarl as they surround Grem and Acer, and the camera moves outside the pub as the customers all attack Grem and Acer, who are both heard groaning.]
[Mater and McQueen come to a stop on a crossroad, as Holley appears.]
Holley: Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you. [scans the bomb]
McQueen: Bomb?
Mater: Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan.
McQueen: Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb on you?
[Just then, Finn comes up with Zündapp tied up.]
Zündapp: You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?!
McQueen: Death ray?!
Finn: Turn off the bomb, Zündapp!
Zündapp: Are you all so dense? It's voice-activated. Everything is voice-activated these days.
Mater: Deactivate! Deactivate!
Bomb: Voice denied. [the bomb activates to explode in 5 minutes]
Mater: Huh!
Zündapp: Oops! Did I forget to mention that it can only be disarmed by the one who activated it?
Holley: [unfolds her shock guns] Say it!
Zündapp: Deactivate.
Bomb: Voice denied. [a minute is taken off the timer]
Mater: Wha...?!
Zündapp: I'm not the one who activated it. Would anyone else like to try? [gets shocked by Holley's shock guns] Ah!
Finn: You read my mind.
Holley: [scoffs] He was getting on my nerves.
McQueen: What do we do?
Victor: [as he and the rest of the lemons surround them all] It's very simple! You blow up.
McQueen: I'm gonna go out on a limb here. These are the guys that want me dead, correct?
Vladimir: It's nothing personal.
Mater: [to all the lemons] Fellers, listen. I know what you're goin’ through. Everybody's been laughin’ at me my whole life too. But becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gon’ make you feel better.
[As they listen, the lemons consider.]
J. Curby: [deploying his gun] Yeah, but it's worth a shot!
[Suddenly, from behind them, Red shoots water at the Gremlins, with Sally joining him, causing them to overturn and flip, with Curby landing on his front behind a metal fence.]
[Finn uses his grappling hooks to move up into the air and pull four lemons towards each other, while Holley uses her wings to carry two other thugs and make them hit a few others. Two of the lemons try to take part, but then Guido takes off their tires.]
Guido: Pit stop!
[Flo also arrives, shining her headlights into Vladimir's eyes, making enough time for Sheriff to put a parking boot on Vladimir's left rear tire.]
Sheriff: Not today, boys!
[Vladimir tries to move, but gives up when he is unable to move with the parking boot on. Guido then moves away another thug, yelling in Italian.]
[Ivan tries to ram into McQueen, but Mater defends, punching him away as well as a couple more of the lemon’s thugs, and yells as he uses his tow hook to throw Tubbs Pacer towards Ramone, who sprays paint over his eyes. He then sees Finn, Mater, McQueen, Holley, and the other Radiator Springs residents all watching angrily at him and the other lemons.]
Tubbs: Retreat! [flees along with the remaining thugs, but immediately finds Sarge and the British Army confronting them]
Sarge: Thanks for the help, Corporal.
Corporal Josh Coolant: Anything for one of Pop's mates.
[After all the lemons have been arrested, Guido is trying to get the bomb off Mater with his wheel gun, but the bolts won’t come off. He is with McQueen, and Luigi, while the Radiator Springs residents, Finn and Holley are watching from barriers put up around the area by the police, while Zündapp is now arrested by the british police.]
Guido: [shouts in Italian, throws his wheel gun towards the ground, and leaves]
McQueen: [to Luigi] Wh... What's he saying? What's wrong?
Luigi: None of his wrenches fit the bolts!
Mater: [looks and then gets a sudden realization] I get it. I get it! I know what needs to be done.
McQueen: Then do it!
Mater: What? No. I can't do it. Look, nobody takes me seriously. I know that now. This ain't Radiator Springs.
McQueen: Yes, it is. Look, you're yourself in Radiator Springs. Be yourself here. And if...if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change, not you. I know that now because I was wrong before. Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.
[While McQueen is talking, Mater starts to feel better]
Mater: Thanks, buddy.
McQueen: No, no, no, you're the actual bomb. Now, let's go!
Mater: Oh, right! Hang on! [hooks up to McQueen, and drives away]
Finn: Where's he going?
Mater: [as they drive through the traffic] Computer!
Computer: Yes, Agent Mater?
Mater: I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen!
Computer: Request acknowledged. [brings out Mater's rockets and activates them]
McQueen: [as they see the road ending at a T junction] Uh, Mater?
Mater: [to his computer] Now I need you to do the chute! The second kind, not the first!
Computer: Deploying chute.
McQueen: [as they get lifted up into the air] Ah... Aah!
[Mater and McQueen are flying over London's buildings, around St Paul's Cathedral, over St. James's Park, and then head towards Buckingham Palace, where Axlerod is with the Queen, Prince Wheeliam, and the spectators on the platform.]
The Queen: Who's winning the race?
[As soon as Mater and McQueen land on the platform, the bodyguards immediately get in front of them, attempting to protect the Queen.]
Bodyguard: Back off! Back away!
The Queen: Ooh! It's Lightning McQueen!
Bodyguard: Get back!
McQueen: No, no, it's OK! OK, t-tell 'em, Mater. Explain.
Mater: Okay! Somebody's been sabotagin’ the racers and hurtin' the cars, and I know who. Oh, wait. Your Majesty. [bows]
Bodyguards: [noticing the bomb on Mater] Bomb! It's a bomb! [all getting their guns out] Freeze! Everybody, down! Back up! Move it!
Crowd members around the racetrack: [evacuating] Aaaaaahhh!!!!! [continue clamoring]
[The Radiator Springs residents then watch from the Victoria Memorial as the bodyguards draw their guns at Mater and McQueen.]
Bodyguard: Get off the stage! Move it!
Finn: [arriving along with Holley] Hold your fire! He can't disarm it! Mater, I don't know what you're doing, but stand down now!
Mater: This ain't nothin’ at all like Radiator Springs.
McQueen: Mater, just cut to the chase!
Mater: Okay. It's him! [points to Axlerod]
Axlerod: What?! Me? You've got to be crazy.
Mater: I figured it out when I realized y'all attached this tickin’ time bomb with Whitworth bolts - the same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph. Holley! Show that picture.
Holley: OK. [gets the photo up on her on-board computer]
Mater: And then I remembered what they say about old British engines: if there ain't no oil under 'em, there ain't no oil in 'em.
Axlerod: What is he talking about?
Mater: It was you leakin’ oil at the party in Japan. You just blamed it on me.
Axlerod: [to Mater] Electric cars don't use oil, ya twit!
Mater: Then you're fakin' it. You didn't convert to no electric. [getting closer and closer to Axlerod] We pop that hood, we gon’ see that engine from that picture right there.
Axlerod: This lorry's crazy! He's going to kill us all! [gets cornered, almost falling off the platform] Stay away!
Holley: But Sir Axlerod created the race, Mater. Why would he want to hurt anyone?
Mater: To make Allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to usin’ oil. I mean, he said it himself with that dee-sguised voice.
Axlerod: Dee-sguised voice?! What are you talking about? You're nuts, you are!
Prince Wheeliam: This is going nowhere fast. We really should go, Grandmother.
The Queen: One moment, I'd like to see where this is going.
Finn: Mater, he created Allinol.
Mater: Yeah, but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was tryna find some’n else? What if he came up with Allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad?
Axlerod: "What if?" You're basing this on a "what if"?!
Bodyguard: Okay, that's it!
Bodyguard: [as they and the police move the Queen, Prince Wheeliam, and the spectators away from the bomb] Come on, lads, clear out.
Axlerod: Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's crazy! Keep away, you idiot!
Finn: Mater?!
Holley: [as the bomb's clock ticks to eight seconds] Mater!
Axlerod: Someone do something!
[Several of the police officers close their eyes, and one by one, Finn, Holley, and McQueen close their eyes as well, as the camera shows the timer at two seconds.]
Axlerod: You're insane, you are! DEACTIVATE!!!!!
[Then the bomb's clock stops at one second, and shows "VOICE ACCEPTED, DEACTIVATED".]
Bomb: Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod. [displays a message of its dialogue, with a texted smiley face :) at the end]
[Axlerod then pants as two police officers turn up beside him, and Mater uses his hook to open Axlerod's hood, showing his engine as it revs.]
Finn: The engine from the photo.
Holley: It's a perfect match.
Axlerod: How did the tow truck figure it out?
McQueen: And it's official. You're coming to all my races from now on.
Mater: Now you're talkin'! [does a high five with McQueen]
[The screen then shows Buckingham Palace at dusk, as many visitors stand behind the gates, while a fanfare is heard performing "Rule, Britannia!". Inside, Mater is trying to get the attention of one of the foot guards.]
Mater: Hyeeugh! [makes garbled noises, then tongue noises]
McQueen: Mater, let's go! You're on.
[They enter the throne room, where the others are part of the crowd. Meanwhile, the two guards at the door make salutes.]
Sir Harley Gassup: Your Majesties, may I present for the investiture of honorary knighthood of the British Realm, Tow Mater of Radiator Springs!
McQueen: [to Mater] Go get 'em, buddy. [joins his friends from Radiator Springs]
[Mater then bows in front of the Queen, whose antenna slowly appears and gently taps it on him.]
The Queen: [tapping her antenna gently on each of Mater's sides] We hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.
Crowd: [all cheer]
Mater: Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna hear none of this "sir" business. By the way, have y'all met each other? Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen. McQueen, McMissile. McMissile, McQueen. Queen, McMissile.
[The screen then shows the Radiator Springs billboard, which now has Mater's picture, before showing a view of Radiator Springs as it scrolls to show Mater at Flo's V8 Cafe with McQueen and the other Radiator Springs residents as he tells the visitors, as well as Van and Minny, about their adventure.]
Mater: So there we was, my rocket jets goin’ full blast, McQueen hangin’ on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowheres, guns drawed. We was goners. But then, out of nowhere this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us!
Minny: That's a very entertaining story, young man.
Van: Oh, Minny, please. Come on! None of this happened! Rocket jets, flying spy cars...
Holley: [swoops down onto the ground] No, you're quite right! It does sound a bit far-fetched.
Mater: Holley! What are you doin' here?
Holley: Hello, Mater! It's so good to see you again.
Mater: [notices Finn arrive] Finn!
Finn: Our satellites picked up an urgent communiqué.
Luigi: So you got-a my email.
Mater: Oh, man. Y'all is gon’ have a great time! [to the visitors] Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile. He's a secret agent. Don't tell nobody! And this is Holley Shiftwell. She's...
Holley: I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so nice to meet you all.
Guido: [his jaw drops, and his forks hit the ground with a clang]
Luigi: Guido believe you now.
Flo: Whoa, honey. You got a nasty dent there.
Holley: Yeah.
Van: Was that from when you swooped in and you saved them in London?
Minny: Van!
Van: What? I'm just asking!
Flo: Ah, don't you worry, sweet pea. My baby Ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time.
Ramone: Yeah, sure thing, man. No problemo. Just let me go get my tools.
Holley: Oh, no, no. I-I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable.
Mater: [grins]
Lizzie: A valuable dent? Oh, she's as crazy as Mater!
Mack: Oh, those two are perfect for each other.
McQueen: You know, there's one thing I still don't get. The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right? So, why didn't I, you know...
Mater: Explode in a fiery inferno?
McQueen: Yeah.
Finn: We couldn't figure that one out, either.
Holley: Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline and Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam, it would explode.
McQueen: Wait a second, Fillmore. You said my fuel was safe!
[Everyone turns towards Fillmore.]
Fillmore: If you're implying that I switched out that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel with my all-natural, sustainable, organic biofuel just because I never trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong, man! It was him! [points to Sarge]
Sarge: Once big oil, always big oil, man.
Fillmore: Tree-hugger.
[Then the screen shows a banner saying "Radiator Springs Grand Prix", before moving down to show Sheriff driving slowly along the main road with the World Grand Prix racers behind him, with spectators watching beside hay bales being used as barriers.]
Sheriff: The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin. All spectators, clear the starting line.
Lewis: Man, I can't wait to get rockin'. This is gonna be wicked!
Jeff: Yeah, we should do this every year.
McQueen: Yeah, I just figured we never found out who the world's fastest car is. Plus, no press, yes trophy, just racing. The way I like it.
Francesco: Francesco likes it like this, too.
McQueen: Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
Francesco: Signorina Sally. It is official. Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world.
Sally: Why, thank you. [chuckles]
Francesco: Which he will have to be to have a chance against Francesco today! [backs up] See you at the finish line, Mc... [notices a label on McQueen's back bumper saying "Ka-ciao, Francesco!"] What is that?
McQueen: Ah, just something I had made up for the occasion.
Francesco: Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny. Was-a funnier when I did it, but it's-a very funny. What are you going to do next? Are you going to take off your fenders? Try it. You'll like it. [leaves to join the grid]
Sally: So, he's not so good-looking.
McQueen: Yeah. Nice try.
Sally: I'm serious!
McQueen: That's why I love you, Sally. [leaves to join the grid] Wish me luck!
Sally: You don't need it!
Flo: Ooh-hm! That Francesco is fine-looking!
Sally: And those open wheels.
Flo: Ooh, I'm gonna have to go get myself some coolant!
[The screen then shows the racers as they are lined up on the road at the traffic light, as they rev their engines. Theme music for the Radiator Springs Grand Prix is heard playing. The traffic light turns green, and the racers set off through the town towards the courthouse, while Mia, Tia, Van, Minny and Todd the Pizza Planet truck are all seen in the crowd.]
Mia and Tia: Go, Lightning!
[After they go around the bend at the courthouse, the screen then skips to show them racing along the road across the desert, as Lewis Hamilton and Jeff Gorvette race for each other's position, Raoul ÇaRoule drives on the dirt beside the road, and Lightning McQueen and Francesco Bernoulli fight for first place, before the racers all go around Willy's Butte. They all continue, with the order being McQueen, Francesco, Carla, Raoul, Shu, Rip, Jeff, Lewis, Nigel, Miguel and Max. Meanwhile, Sally, Fillmore, Sarge, Sheriff, Red, Flo, Ramone, Luigi, Guido, Finn, Mater, and Holley are watching from a small hill located next to the oval-shaped track that goes around Willy's Butte.]
Sally: Go, Stickers!
Fillmore: Right on, man!
Flo: Go get 'em, tiger!
Guido: Bravo, bravo!
Luigi: Go, Lightning, go!
Mater: Go, McQueen! Whoo-hoo!
Holley: [getting a bleeping sound from her projection lamp, as Siddeley arrives] Finn? Time to go. Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly.
Mater: You're leavin' already?
Finn: We've got another mission, Mater. Just stopped by here to pick something up.
Mater: Somethin' tells me you're not talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers.
Finn: Her Majesty asked for you personally, Mater.
Mater: But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
Holley: We know.
Finn: [to Mater] Spy or not, you're still the smartest, most honest chap we've ever met.
Holley: Don't forget massively charming.
Mater: Well, thanks. [to Finn and Holley] But as much fun as it was hangin' with y'all, this... [looks towards the townsfolk, who are all shouting excitedly] This is home.
Holley: That's all right. We understand. [to Mater] But I'll be back. You still owe me that first date.
Finn: [to Mater] And if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.
Mater: Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you. Actually, there is one thing.
[Then the screen shows Mater going very fast on the road leading up to Radiator Springs with his rocket jets.]
Mater: Whoo-hoo! [laughs] Whoo-ee! I'll be doggone!
Otis: [sighs, then gasps to see Mater, who then grabs him with his hook, with Otis' hubcaps and the dust on him falling off] Whoa, whoa, whoa! [as he gets tossed into Ramone's House of Body Art] Thanks, Mater!
[As Mater rushes through the town, the wind blows maps out of Van's luggage carrier, and Mater zooms past the statue of Stanley, which spins around very fast before landing back in place. Mater then goes around Willy's Butte.]
[Mater then starts going past the racers.]
Mater: Ha-ha-ha! Whoo! [overtaking Francesco] Whoo-hoo!
Francesco: Impossible!
Mater: [catching up to McQueen] Ha-ha!
McQueen: Mater!
Mater: Check it out. They let me keep the rockets!
McQueen: I'll see you at the finish line, buddy! [accelerates]
Mater: Not if I see you first! [accelerates] Yippee!
[The screen is then shown in the air as McQueen and Mater race off into the distance, followed by Francesco, Carla, Raoul, Jeff, Lewis, Rip, Miguel, Nigel, Shu and Max. Siddeley then appears, winking to the audience, before flying away, as the screen fades out.]
[The end credits then show as "Collision of Worlds" and then lastly "Nobody's Fool" play.]
